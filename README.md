# Macro Database
It's one thing to understand companies existing in countries, sectors and industries and another to understand 
movements within these categories due to macro economics. The former I attempted to solve with the 
[FinanceDatabase](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase) and the MacroDatabase is an attempt to cover the latter. 

Within this database of over 570.000 datasets, you are able to view an incredibly large amount of financial indicators 
(e.g. GDP, employment rates, interest & inflation rates), prices (e.g. commodities, CPIs and housing indices), an extensive 
variety of country data (e.g. government bond yields of the Netherlands, real consumption of households in Japan) and 
so much more.
