  "notes": "Adult (15+) literacy rate (%). Total is the percentage of the population age 15 and above who can, with understanding, read and write a short, simple statement on their everyday life. Generally, 'literacy' also encompasses 'numeracy', the ability to make simple arithmetic calculations. This indicator is calculated by dividing the number of literates aged 15 years and over by the corresponding age group population and multiplying the result by 100.\n\nWorld Bank Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics\n\nSource Indicator: SE.ADT.LITR.ZS"
