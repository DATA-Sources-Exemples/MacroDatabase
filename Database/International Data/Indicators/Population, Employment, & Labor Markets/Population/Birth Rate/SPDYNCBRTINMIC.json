  "notes": "Crude birth rate indicates the number of live births occurring during the year, per 1,000 population estimated at midyear. Subtracting the crude death rate from the crude birth rate provides the rate of natural increase, which is equal to the rate of population change in the absence of migration.\n\nNations that are included in this data series are listed at http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-and-lending-groups\n\nSource Indicator: SP.DYN.CBRT.IN"
