Information on a nationality basis is useful to analyse potential support that might be available from the parent company and to understand links between borrowers in different countries and sectors.\nFor example, the debts of a Cayman Islands subsidiary of a Brazilian bank may be guaranteed by the parent bank. Consistent with the approach taken in the international banking statistics, the BIS bases the nationality of an issuer on the residency of its controlling parent, regardless of any intermediate owners.
