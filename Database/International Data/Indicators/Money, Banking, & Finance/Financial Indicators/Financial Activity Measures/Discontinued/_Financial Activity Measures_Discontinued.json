Thank you for your patience while we improve the CFSI.\n\nThe CFSI is designed to track distress in the US financial system on a continuous basis giving the financial-system supervisors the ability to monitor stressful episodes as they are building in the economy. Such early detection is important because financial stress can quickly be amplified when stress is occurring in more than one market. The CFSI tracks stress in six types of markets: credit markets, equity markets, foreign exchange markets, funding markets (interbank markets), real estate markets, and securitization markets. The CFSI is a coincident indicator of systemic stress, where a high value of CFSI indicates high systemic financial stress. Units of CFSI are expressed as standardized differences from the mean (z-scores).\n\nThe CFSI data for weekends and holidays is extrapolated.\n\nTo interpret the stress continuum, CFSI is first divided it into four levels or grades. The grade thresholds are dynamic and move slowly over time. The four grades are:\n\nGrade Description Range\nGrade 1 Low stress period CFSI < -0.733\nGrade 2 Normal stress period -0.733 \u2265 CFSI < 0.544\nGrade 3 Moderate stress period 0.544 \u2265 CFSI < 1.82\nGrade 4 Significant stress period CFSI \u2265 1.82",

The interbank liquidity spread is measured as the difference between the 3-Month LIBOR and the 3-Month US Treasury Yield. The spread reflects the perception of counterparty risk in interbank lending by measuring the risk premium associated with lending to commercial banks. The spread increases when either market liquidity is scarce or when counterparty default risk increases, both of which are associated with increasing financial stress.",
