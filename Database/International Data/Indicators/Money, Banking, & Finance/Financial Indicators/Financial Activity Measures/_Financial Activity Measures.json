    "notes": "The CFNAI Diffusion Index is a metric based on the magnitude of the weight given to each of the underlying indicators in the CFNAI when constructing the index as their weighted average. The index is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the underlying indicators whose contribution to the CFNAI is positive in a given month less the sum of the absolute values of the weights for those indicators whose contribution is negative or neutral, expressed as a proportion of the total sum of the absolute values of the weights. By construction, the sum of the absolute values of the CFNAI weights is one. To make this measure comparable to the CFNAI-MA3, the three-month moving average is calculated.

As the replacement index provides limited historical data, the KCFSI uses predicted values for the S&P U.S. BMI Banks Index between 1989 and 2004, resulting from a linear regression of the replacement index against the original index. This methodology produces highly correlated values of the current KCFSI with previous values, suggesting a minimal effect on the KCFSI.

Thus, a positive value for an individual subindex indicates that the corresponding aspect of financial conditions is tighter than on average, while negative values indicate the opposite.\n\nThe nonfinancial leverage subindex of the NFCI best exemplifies how leverage can serve as an early warning signal for financial stress and its potential impact on economic growth. The positive weight assigned to both the household and nonfinancial business leverage measures in this NFCI subindex make it characteristic of the feedback process between the financial and nonfinancial sectors of the economy often referred to as the \u201cfinancial accelerator.\" Increasingly tighter financial conditions are associated with rising risk premiums and declining asset values. The net worth of households and nonfinancial firms is, thus, reduced at the same time that credit tightens. This leads to a period of deleveraging (i.e., debt reduction) across the financial and nonfinancial sectors of the economy and ultimately to lower economic activity.\" Source: http://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/research/data/nfci/background.cfm.\n\nFor further information, please visit the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's NFCI website at http://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/nfci/index.cfm.",
