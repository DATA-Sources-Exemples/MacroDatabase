  "notes": "This series represents the contributions of the manufacturing sector to the Midwest Economy Index (MEI). This series is a weighted average of state and regional indicators encompassing the entirety of the five states in the Seventh Federal Reserve District (Illinois, Iowa, Iowa, Michigan, and Wisconsin).\n\nThe series measures the growth in nonfarm business activity in the Midwest Region based on the manufacturing sector.\n\nA zero value represents an average contribution to the MEI by the manufacturing, whereas a positive value indicates that an above-average contribution to MEI; and negative values indicate below-average contribution to MEI.\n\nFor further information about the Midwest Economy Index, go to http://midwest.chicagofedblogs.org/archives/2011/03/mei_by_scott_br.html and http://chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/chicago_fed_letter/2010/cflnovember2010_280.pdf ."
