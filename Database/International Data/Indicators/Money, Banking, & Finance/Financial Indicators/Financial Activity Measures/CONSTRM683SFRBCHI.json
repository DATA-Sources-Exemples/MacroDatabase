  "notes": "This series represents the contributions of Midwest Region's construction sector to the Midwest Economy Index (MEI). The Midwest Region contribution specifically focuses on indicators existing only at a regional level. This series is the weighted average of regional variables measuring the growth in nonfarm business activity based on construction sector indicators for the Midwest.\n\nA zero value represents an average contribution to the MEI by the Midwest Region, whereas a positive value indicates that an above-average contribution to MEI; and negative values indicate below-average contribution to MEI.\n\nFor further information about the Midwest Economy Index, go to http://midwest.chicagofedblogs.org/archives/2011/03/mei_by_scott_br.html and http://chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/chicago_fed_letter/2010/cflnovember2010_280.pdf."
