  "notes": "Starting with the September 14, 2021, release, the SNL U.S. Bank index, an underlying index used in the calculation of the KCFSI, has been replaced with the S&P U.S. BMI Banks Index on the S&P Capital IQ platform. As the replacement index provides limited historical data, the KCFSI uses predicted values for the S&P U.S. BMI Banks Index between 1989 and 2004, resulting from a linear regression of the replacement index against the original index. This methodology produces highly correlated values of the current KCFSI with previous values, suggesting a minimal effect on the KCFSI.
