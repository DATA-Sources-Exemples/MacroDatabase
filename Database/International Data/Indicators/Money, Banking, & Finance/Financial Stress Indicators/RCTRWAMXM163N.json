  "notes": "This series is calculated using total regulatory capital as the numerator and risk-weighted assets as the denominator. Data are compiled in accordance with the guidelines of either Basel I or Basel II. It measures the capital adequacy of deposit takers. Capital adequacy and availability ultimately determine the degree of robustness of financial institutions to withstand shocks to their balance sheets.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016, International Monetary Fund.
