  "notes": "This series is calculated by using the core measure of liquid assets as the numerator and short-term liabilities as the denominator. The ratio can also be calculated by taking the broad measure of liquid assets as the numerator. This series is a liquid asset ratio and is intended to capture the liquidity mismatch of assets and liabilities, and provides an indication of the extent to which deposit takers can meet the short-term withdrawal of funds without facing liquidity problems.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016, International Monetary Fund.
