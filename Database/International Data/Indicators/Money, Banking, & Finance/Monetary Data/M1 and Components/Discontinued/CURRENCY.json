  "notes": "This weekly series is discontinued and will no longer be updated. The non-seasonally adjusted version of this weekly series is WCURRNS (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WCURRNS), and the seasonally adjusted monthly series is CURRSL (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CURRSL).\n\nStarting on February 23, 2021, the H.6 statistical release is now published at a monthly frequency and contains only monthly average data needed to construct the monetary aggregates. Weekly average, non-seasonally adjusted data will continue to be made available, while weekly average, seasonally adjusted data will no longer be provided. For further information about the changes to the H.6 Statistical Release, see the announcements (https://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/h6.html) provided by the source.\n\nThe currency component of M1, sometimes called \"money stock currency,\" is defined as currency in circulation outside the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve Banks. Data on total currency in circulation are obtained weekly from balance sheets of the Federal Reserve Banks and from the U.S. Treasury. Weekly currency in circulation data are published each week on the Federal Reserve Board's H.4.1 statistical release \"Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks.\" Vault cash is reported on the FR 2900 and subtracted from total currency in circulation. For institutions that do not file the FR 2900, vault cash is estimated using data reported on the Call Reports."
