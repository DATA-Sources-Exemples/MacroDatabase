It has been consolidated under the following series, which will continue to be updated: MDLM (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MDLM).\n\nStarting on February 23, 2021, the H.6 statistical release is now published at a monthly frequency and contains only monthly average data needed to construct the monetary aggregates. Components of the monetary aggregates are reported at a total industry level without a breakdown by banks and thrifts. For further information about the changes to the H.6 Statistical Release, see the announcements (https://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/h6.html) provided by the source.\n\nThe other checkable deposits component of M1 consists of negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts and automated transfer service (ATS) balances at banks, thrifts, and foreign related institutions, credit union share draft balances, and demand deposits at thrifts. These items are reported on the FR 2900 and, for institutions that do not file the FR 2900, are estimated using data reported on the Call Reports."
