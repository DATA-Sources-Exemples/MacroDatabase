  "notes": "This series has been discontinued and will no longer be updated. Starting on February 23, 2021, the H.6 statistical release is now published at a monthly frequency and contains only monthly average data needed to construct the monetary aggregates. Components of the monetary aggregates are reported at a total industry level without a breakdown by banks and thrifts. For further information about the changes to the H.6 Statistical Release, see the announcements (https://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/h6.html) provided by the source.\n\nThis series is calculated as the sum of savings deposits; small-denomination time deposits; and retail money funds. Note, that there is a break in the data as weekly data for savings deposits and small-denomination at thrift institutions were not available before November 3 1980."
