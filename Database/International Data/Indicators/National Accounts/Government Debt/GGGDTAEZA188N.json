This includes debt liabilities in the form of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), currency and deposits, debt securities, loans, insurance, pensions and standardized guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Thus, all liabilities in the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) system are debt, except for equity and investment fund shares and financial derivatives and employee stock options.
