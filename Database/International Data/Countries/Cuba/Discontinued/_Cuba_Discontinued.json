The figures are deflated using the following methodology: {(0.5)*[Ft/P_et + Ft-1/P_et-1]}/[GDPt/P_at] where F is the level international public debt, P_e is end-of period CPI, and P_a is average annual CPI. GDP is from World Development Indicators. End-of period CPI is taken from IFS line PCPI month of December (or if not available Q4). Average annual CPI is constructed from the monthly CPI figure taken from IFS line PCPI.\n\nSource Code: GFDD.DM.07",
