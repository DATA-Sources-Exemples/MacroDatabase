  "notes": "The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category \"Maintenance and Repair of the Dwelling (04.3)\" is a classification of services and nondurable goods that include the Services for and Materials for the Maintenance and Repair of the Dwelling. Maintenance and Repair of Dwellings are distinguished by two features. First, they are activities that have to be undertaken regularly in order to maintain the dwelling in good working order. Second, they do not change the dwelling's performance, capacity or expected service life. Maintenance and Repair of Dwellings includes minor tasks commonly carried out by both tenants and owners, such as interior decoration and repairs to fittings. Also includes major tasks carried out by owners only, such as plastering walls or repairing roofs. Only expenditures, which tenants and owner- occupiers incur on materials and services for minor maintenance and repair, are part of individual consumption expenditure of households. Expenditures, which owner-occupiers incur on materials and services for major maintenance and repair, are not part of individual consumption expenditure of households. Purchases of materials made by tenants or owner-occupiers with the intention of undertaking the maintenance or repair themselves should be shown under (04.3.1). If tenants or owner-occupiers pay an enterprise to carry out the maintenance or repair, the total value of the service, including the costs of the materials used, should be shown under (04.3.2).\n\nThis category contains the Materials for the Maintenance and Repair of the Dwelling (04.3.1) and Services for the Maintenance and Repair of the Dwelling (04.3.2) subcategories.\n\nThis is a subcategory of Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas, and Other Fuels (04) category.\n\nInformation provided in the notes pertaining to HICP classifications can be found from the source at: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/prc_hicp_esms.htm.\n\nCopyright, European Union, 1995-2016, http://ec.europa.eu/geninfo/legal_notices_en.htm#copyright."
