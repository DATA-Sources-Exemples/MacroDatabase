  "notes": "The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category \"All-Items Excluding Administered Prices (00XAP)\" excludes Administered Prices (AP) from the HICP for All-Items.\n\nFor a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set, or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.\n\nFor some European Union Member States, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes, while with other European Union Member States, these are provided by National Central Banks. Eurostat, the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, and the European Central Bank verify final classification for all countries.\n\nInformation provided in the notes relating to Administered Prices HICP classifications can be found from the source at:\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/hicp/methodology/hicp-administered-prices.\n\nCopyright, European Union, 1995-2016, http://ec.europa.eu/geninfo/legal_notices_en.htm#copyright."
