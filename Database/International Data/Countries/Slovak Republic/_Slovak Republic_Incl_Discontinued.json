    "notes": "The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) \"Administered Prices (AP)\" attempts to identify governmental influence on the prices of goods and services.\n\nFor a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICPs) to be included in the Administered Price (AP) category, more than 50% of its underlying items must be either directly set or heavily influenced by a governmental body or regulator (whether national, regional, or local). There are two types of Administered Prices as defined by Eurostat. Fully Administered Prices (APFULL) includes those that are directly set by the government. Examples include local public transportation charges, education fees, theater tickets, waste collection, childcare, and fees for administrative documents. Mainly Administered Prices (APMAIN) covers the prices of goods and services over which the government or regulator has significant influence. These may include prices that require approval or permission by national regulatory authorities for their change. The influence of the national regulator's decisions could be direct (on retail prices) or indirect (via wholesale prices). However, the regulator must have a significant influence on the consumer price. This index does not provide an exact measure of the development of administered and non-administered prices.\n\nFor some European Union member states, HICPs items considered for inclusion in the administered prices subcategory are supplied by National Statistical Institutes; for other European Union member states, these are provided by national central banks. Eurostat, the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, and the European Central Bank verify final classification for all countries.\n\nInformation provided in the notes relating to Administered Prices HICP classifications can be found from the source at: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/hicp/methodology/hicp-administered-prices.\n\nCopyright, European Union, 1995-2016, http://ec.europa.eu/geninfo/legal_notices_en.htm#copyright.",

Rentals are all rentals actually paid by tenants, i.e. the rentals the tenant pays to the landlord regardless of any social benefits the tenant receives from public authorities (including payments which at the tenant's discretion go directly to the landlord). Rentals normally include payment for the use of the land on which the property stands, the dwelling occupied, the fixtures and fittings for heating, plumbing, lighting, etc., and, in the case of a dwelling let furnished, the furniture.\n\nRentals also include payment for the use of a garage to provide parking in connection with the dwelling. The garage does not have to be physically contiguous to the dwelling; nor does it have to be leased from the same landlord.\n\nThis category excludes accommodation services of educational establishments and hostels (11.2.0), of holiday villages and holiday centers (11.2.0), and of retirement homes for elderly persons (12.4.0). Rentals also do not include payment for the use of garages or parking spaces not providing parking in connection with the dwelling (07.2.4). Nor do they include charges for water supply (04.4.1), refuse collection (04.4.2), and sewerage collection (04.4.3); co-proprietor charges for caretaking, gardening, stairwell cleaning, heating and lighting, maintenance of lifts and refuse disposal chutes, etc. in multi-occupied buildings (04.4.4); charges for electricity (04.5.1) and gas (04.5.2); and charges for heating and hot water supplied by district heating plants (04.5.5).\n\nThis is a subcategory of Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas, and Other Fuels (04) category.\n\nInformation provided in the notes pertaining to HICP classifications can be found from the source at: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/prc_hicp_esms.htm.\n\nCopyright, European Union, 1995-2016, http://ec.europa.eu/geninfo/legal_notices_en.htm#copyright.",

Maintenance and Repair of Dwellings are distinguished by two features. First, they are activities that have to be undertaken regularly in order to maintain the dwelling in good working order. Second, they do not change the dwelling's performance, capacity or expected service life. Maintenance and Repair of Dwellings includes minor tasks commonly carried out by both tenants and owners, such as interior decoration and repairs to fittings. Also includes major tasks carried out by owners only, such as plastering walls or repairing roofs. Only expenditures, which tenants and owner- occupiers incur on materials and services for minor maintenance and repair, are part of individual consumption expenditure of households. Expenditures, which owner-occupiers incur on materials and services for major maintenance and repair, are not part of individual consumption expenditure of households. Purchases of materials made by tenants or owner-occupiers with the intention of undertaking the maintenance or repair themselves should be shown under (04.3.1). If tenants or owner-occupiers pay an enterprise to carry out the maintenance or repair, the total value of the service, including the costs of the materials used, should be shown under (04.3.2).\n\nThis category contains the Materials for the Maintenance and Repair of the Dwelling (04.3.1) and Services for the Maintenance and Repair of the Dwelling (04.3.2) subcategories.\n\nThis is a subcategory of Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas, and Other Fuels (04) category.\n\nInformation provided in the notes pertaining to HICP classifications can be found from the source at: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/prc_hicp_esms.htm.\n\nCopyright, European Union, 1995-2016, http://ec.europa.eu/geninfo/legal_notices_en.htm#copyright.",

An increase in the Boone indicator implies a deterioration of the competitive conduct of financial intermediaries.\n\nA measure of degree of competition, calculated as the elasticity of profits to marginal costs. To obtain the elasticity, the log of profits (measured by return on assets) is regressed on the log of marginal costs. The estimated coefficient (computed from the first derivative of a trans-log cost function) is the elasticity. The rationale behind the indicator is that higher profits are achieved by more-efficient banks. Hence, the more negative the Boone indicator, the higher the degree of competition is because the effect of reallocation is stronger. Estimations of the Boone indicator in this database follow the methodology used by Schaeck and Cih\u00e1k 2010 with a modification to use marginal costs instead of average costs.
