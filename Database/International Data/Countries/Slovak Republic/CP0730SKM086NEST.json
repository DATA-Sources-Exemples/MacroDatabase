  "notes": "The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category \"Transport Services (07.3)\" is a classification of services. Purchases of transport services are generally classified by mode of transport. When a ticket covers two or more modes of transport - for example, intra-urban bus and underground or inter-urban train and ferry - and the expenditure cannot be apportioned between them, then such purchases should be classified in (07.3.5). Costs of meals, snacks, drinks, refreshments or accommodation services have to be included if covered by the fare and not separately priced. If separately priced, these costs have to be classified in Division 11. School transport services are included, but ambulance services are excluded (06.2.3).\n\nThis category contains Passenger Transport by Railway (07.3.1), Passenger Transport by Road (07.3.2), Passenger Transport by Air (07.3.3), Passenger Transport by Sea and Inland Waterway (07.3.4), Combined Passenger Transport (07.3.5), Other Purchased Transport Services (07.3.6).\n\nThis category is a subcategory of Transport (07) category.\n\nInformation provided in the notes pertaining to HICP classifications can be found from the source at: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/prc_hicp_esms.htm.\n\nCopyright, European Union, 1995-2016, http://ec.europa.eu/geninfo/legal_notices_en.htm#copyright."
