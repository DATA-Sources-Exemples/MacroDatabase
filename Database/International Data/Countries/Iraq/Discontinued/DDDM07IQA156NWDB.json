Table 12A (international debt amount: all issuers) / GDP. End of year data (i.e. December data) are considered for debt securities.

GDP is from World Development Indicators. End-of period CPI is taken from IFS line PCPI month of December (or if not available Q4). Average annual CPI is constructed from the monthly CPI figure taken from IFS line PCPI.\n\nSource Code: GFDD.DM.07"
