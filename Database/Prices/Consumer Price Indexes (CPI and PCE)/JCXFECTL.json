  "notes": "Projections of personal consumption expenditures less food and energy (Core PCE) inflation rate are fourth quarter growth rates, that is, percentage changes from the fourth quarter of the prior year to the fourth quarter of the indicated year. Core PCE inflation rate is the percentage rates of change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures less food and energy. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. The range for each variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in the given year; the central tendencies exclude the three highest and three lowest projections for each year. This series represents the low value of the central tendency forecast established by the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nDigitized originals of this release can be found at https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/publication/?pid=677."
