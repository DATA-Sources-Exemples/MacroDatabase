It is calculated using Federal Outlays: Interest (FYOINT) (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYOINT) and Gross Domestic Product (GDPA) (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPA):\nFYOIGDA188S = ((FYOINT/1000)/GDPA)*100\nFYOINT/1000 transforms FYOINT from millions of dollars to billions of dollars."
