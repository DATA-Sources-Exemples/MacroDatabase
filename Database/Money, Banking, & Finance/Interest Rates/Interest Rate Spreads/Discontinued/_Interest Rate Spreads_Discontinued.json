    "notes": "Series is calculated as the spread between 3-Month LIBOR based on US dollars (USD3MTD156N) and 3-Month Treasury Bill (DTB3 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DTB3)).\nStarting with the update on June 21, 2019, the Treasury bond data used in calculating interest rate spreads is obtained directly from the U.S. Treasury Department (https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield).\n\nThe 3-Month LIBOR based on US Dollars has been removed from FRED (https://news.research.stlouisfed.org/2022/01/ice-benchmark-administration-ltd-iba-data-to-be-removed-from-fred/) as of January 31, 2022, so this calculated series has been discontinued and will no longer be updated. Users interested in calculating a similar credit risk can use the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which has been identified as the rate that represents best practice for use in certain new U.S. Dollar derivatives and other financial contracts. For more details, see the article Transition from LIBOR (https://www.newyorkfed.org/arrc/sofr-transition) from the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (AARC).",
