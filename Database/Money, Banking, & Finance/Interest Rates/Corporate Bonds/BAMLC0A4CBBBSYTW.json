  "notes": "This data represents the semi-annual yield to worst of the ICE BofA BBB US Corporate Index, a subset of the ICE BofA US Corporate Master Index tracking the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. This subset includes all securities with a given investment grade rating BBB. When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nYield to worst is the lowest potential yield that a bond can generate without the issuer defaulting. The standard US convention for this series is to use semi-annual coupon payments, whereas the standard in the foreign markets is to use coupon payments with frequencies of annual, semi-annual, quarterly, and monthly.\n\nThe index data referenced herein is the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC, its affiliates, (\"ICE\") and/or its Third Party Suppliers and has been licensed for use by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
