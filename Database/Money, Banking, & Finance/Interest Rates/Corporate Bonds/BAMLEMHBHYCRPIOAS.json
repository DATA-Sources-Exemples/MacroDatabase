  "notes": "This data represents the Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) for the ICE BofA High Yield Emerging Markets Corporate Plus Index is a subset of the ICE BofA Emerging Markets Corporate Plus Index, which includes only securities rated BB1 or lower. The same inclusion rules apply for this series as those that apply for ICE BofA Emerging Markets Corporate Plus Index (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLEMCBPITRIV?cid=32413).\n\nThe ICE BofA OASs are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nThe index data referenced herein is the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC, its affiliates, (\"ICE\") and/or its Third Party Suppliers and has been licensed for use by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
