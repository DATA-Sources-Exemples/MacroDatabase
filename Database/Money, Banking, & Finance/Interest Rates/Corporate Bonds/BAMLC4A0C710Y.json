  "notes": "The ICE BofA Option-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. The US Corporate 7-10 Year OAS is a subset of the ICE BofA US Corporate Master OAS, BAMLC0A0CM. This subset includes all securities with a remaining term to maturity of greater than or equal to 7 years and less than 10 years. When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nThe index data referenced herein is the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC, its affiliates, (\"ICE\") and/or its Third Party Suppliers and has been licensed for use by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
