  "notes": "This data represents the semi-annual yield to worst of the ICE BofA Crossover US Emerging Markets Liquid Corporate Plus Index is a subset of the ICE BofA Emerging Markets Liquid Corporate Plus Index, which includes only securities rated BBB1 through BB3. The same inclusion rules apply for this series as those that apply for ICE BofA Emerging Markets Liquid Corporate Plus Index (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLEMCLLCRPIUSTRIV?cid=32413). When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nYield to worst is the lowest potential yield that a bond can generate without the issuer defaulting. The standard US convention for this series is to use semi-annual coupon payments, whereas the standard in the foreign markets is to use coupon payments with frequencies of annual, semi-annual, quarterly, and monthly.\n\nThe index data referenced herein is the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC, its affiliates, (\"ICE\") and/or its Third Party Suppliers and has been licensed for use by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
