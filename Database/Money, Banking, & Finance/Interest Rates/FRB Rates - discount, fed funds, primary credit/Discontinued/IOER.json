See the source's announcement (https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210602a.htm) for more details.\n\nThe interest rate on excess reserves (IOER rate) is determined by the Board of Governors and gives the Federal Reserve an additional tool to conduct monetary policy.\n\nSee Policy Tools (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reqresbalances.htm) for more information."
