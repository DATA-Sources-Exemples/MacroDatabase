A maintenance period is the period of time over which depository institutions maintain balances at a Federal Reserve Bank, either directly or through a pass-through correspondent, to satisfy reserve balance requirements. A common two-week maintenance period consists of 14 consecutive days beginning on a Thursday and ending on the second Wednesday thereafter. The first two-week maintenance period began on June 27, 2013. For more information see http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reqresbalances.htm"
