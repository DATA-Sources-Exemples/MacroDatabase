  "notes": "Data for the period prior to 1994 come from the working paper \"A New Federal Funds Rate Target Series: September 27, 1982 - December 31, 1993\" (Thornton, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 2005, http://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/2005/2005-032.pdf). Due to an error in the paper values from April 2, 1986 - April 20, 1986 were adjusted manually to 7.3125%. Data from 1994 to the present are derived from FOMC meeting transcripts and FOMC meeting statements, http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/.\n\nEffective December 16, 2008, target rate is reported as a range.
