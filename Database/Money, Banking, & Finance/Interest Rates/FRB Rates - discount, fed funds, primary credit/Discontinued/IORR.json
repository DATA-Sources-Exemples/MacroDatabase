  "notes": "Starting July 29, 2021, the interest rate on excess reserves (IOER (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IOER)) and the interest rate on required reserves (IORR (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IORR)) were replaced with a single rate, the interest rate on reserve balances (IORB (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IORB)). See the source's announcement (https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210602a.htm) for more details.\n\nThe interest rate on required reserves (IORR rate) is determined by the Board of Governors and is intended to eliminate effectively the implicit tax that reserve requirements used to impose on depository institutions.\n\nSee Policy Tools (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reqresbalances.htm) for more information."
