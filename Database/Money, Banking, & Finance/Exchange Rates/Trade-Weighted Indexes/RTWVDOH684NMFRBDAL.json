  "notes": "These indexes calculate the inflation-adjusted value of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of countries to which the state exports. The real exchange rates are aggregated across countries for each state using the annual average export share to the country. For the most recent year where export share data is not available, the prior year' number is used instead. The indexes should allow analysts to more precisely identify the exchange rate movements that most affect demand for a state's exports.
