  "notes": "Until 1974, fiduciary business could be recorded on the balance sheet; thereafter, it had to be entered as an off-balance-sheet item.\nAs of 1981, precious metal accounts are included in the balance sheet.\nAs of 1992, including non-monetary balance sheet claims and liabilities from lending.\nAs of 1995, transactions in financial derivatives must be recorded in gross terms, resulting in a significant increase in total assets.\nAs of 1998, including non-monetary balance sheet claims and liabilities from repo transactions.\nAs of 2000, the majority of banks have again taken non-monetary claims and liabilities from lending and repo transactions off the balance sheet.\n\nFor the Raiffeisen banks, data prior to 1919 was reported retrospectively."
