See BFBF4QTOTALNSAIN (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BFBF4QTOTALNSAIN) for an alternative.\n\nThis series provides the number of employer businesses that originate from Business Applications (BA) within four quarters from the quarter of application. By definition, the end-point of this series is determined by the most recent quarter for which the administrative data is available on payroll."
