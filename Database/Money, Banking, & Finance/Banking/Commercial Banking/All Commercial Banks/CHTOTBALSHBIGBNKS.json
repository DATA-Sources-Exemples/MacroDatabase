  "notes": "Until 1974, fiduciary business could be recorded on the balance sheet; thereafter, it had to be entered as an off-balance-sheet item.\nAs of 1981, precious metal accounts are included in the balance sheet.\nAs of 1992, including non-monetary balance sheet claims and liabilities from lending.\nAs of 1995, transactions in financial derivatives must be recorded in gross terms, resulting in a significant increase in total assets.\nAs of 1998, including non-monetary balance sheet claims and liabilities from repo transactions.\nAs of 2000, the majority of banks have again taken non-monetary claims and liabilities from lending and repo transactions off the balance sheet.\n\nIn 1913, certain data which the individual banks had reported in previous years was aggregated due to the creation of new bank categories. Subsequently, this data was recorded in the aggregated form. Consequently, figures are available for big banks as far back as 1906.(Cf. table A1 in the commentary section.\nhttp://www.snb.ch/en/mmr/reference/histz_snb_book/source).\nAs of 2003, one big bank uses netting, resulting in a marked decrease in its total assets.\nIn 2004, two big banks switched to US GAAP, resulting in an appreciable increase in their total assets."
