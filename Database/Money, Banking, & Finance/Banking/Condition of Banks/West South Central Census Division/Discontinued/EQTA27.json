Additional consolidated data is available on the FDIC's Bank Data and Statistics (https://www.fdic.gov/bank/statistical/).\n\nFor each size category, the sum of equity held by banks with average assets greater than zero is divided by average assets. Equity equals Total Equity Capital call item RCFD3210. Total Assets equals call item RCFD2170.\nThe asset classes are determined by using Average Total Assets call item RCFD2170 greater than $300M and less than $1B.\nGeographic location for West South Central Census Division is determined by the Physical State Code call item RSSD9210 IN (5,22,40,48), where the number codes represent Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas respectively.\n\nUsers are advised to use the Federal Reserve Board of Governors' data dictionary (https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/mdrm/data-dictionary) to retrieve detailed information for specific call items.\n\nThis series is calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis using raw data that are collected by the FFIEC.
