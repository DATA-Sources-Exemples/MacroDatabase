Nonperforming loans are those loans that bank managers classify as 90-days or more past due or nonaccrual in the call report. Precisely, total nonperforming loans equals the sum of Total Loans and Lease Finance Receivables, Nonaccrual call item RCFD1403 and Total Loans and Lease Finance Receivables, Past Due 90 Days and More and Still Accruing call item RCFD1407. Total loans equals Total Loans and Leases, Net of Unearned Income call item RCFD2122.\nThe asset classes are determined by using Average Total Assets call item RCFD2170 less than $300M.\nGeographic location for Mountain Census Division is determined by the Physical State Code call item RSSD9210 IN (4,8,16,30,32,35,49,56), where the number codes represent Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming respectively.\n\nUsers are advised to use the Federal Reserve Board of Governors' data dictionary (https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/mdrm/data-dictionary) to retrieve detailed information for specific call items.\n\nThis series is calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis using raw data that are collected by the FFIEC.
