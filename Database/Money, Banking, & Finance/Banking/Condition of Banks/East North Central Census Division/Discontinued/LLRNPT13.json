  "notes": "This series is discontinued and will no longer be updated. Additional consolidated data is available on the FDIC's Bank Data and Statistics (https://www.fdic.gov/bank/statistical/).\n\nEach bank is classified by whether the ratio of its allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) to nonperforming loans is greater than one. For each size category, the sum of all assets held by banks where this ratio is greater than one is divided by the sum all assets held by banks in the class. The allowance for loan and lease losses is the sum of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses call item RCFD3123 and Allocated Transfer Risk Reserves call item RCFD3128. Total nonperforming loans equals the sum of Total Loans and Lease Finance Receivables, Nonaccrual call item RCFD1403 and Total Loans and Lease Financing Receivables, Past due 90 Days or More and Still Accruing call item RCFD1407.\nThe asset classes are determined by using Average Total Assets call item RCFD2170 less than $300M.\nGeographic location for East North Central Census Division is determined by the Physical State Code call item RSSD9210 IN (17,18,26,39,55), where the number codes represent Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin respectively.\n\nUsers are advised to use the Federal Reserve Board of Governors' data dictionary (https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/mdrm/data-dictionary) to retrieve detailed information for specific call items.\n\nThis series is calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis using raw data that are collected by the FFIEC.
