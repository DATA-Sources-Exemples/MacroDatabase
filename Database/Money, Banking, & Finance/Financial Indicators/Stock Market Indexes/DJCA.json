The market typically closes at 4 PM ET, except for holidays when it sometimes closes early.\n\nThe Dow Jones Composite Average is combination of all three major Dow Jones Averages (Industrial, Utility, and Transportation). Since the Composite Average is made up of this select group of prominent stocks, Dow Jones refers to it as a blue chip microcosm of the US stock market.
