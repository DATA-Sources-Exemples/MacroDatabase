  "notes": "This series has been discontinued with a phase of the simplification of reserves administration (https://federalregister.gov/a/2012-8562). The simplification of reserves administration provides an opportunity to streamline the process of calculating the monetary base so that it reflects the fundamental concept of this measure. The fundamental concept of the monetary base, or \"high-powered money,\" is the sum of total balances maintained by depository institutions at the Federal Reserve plus currency in circulation.\nPlease see the new monetary base at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGMBASE."
