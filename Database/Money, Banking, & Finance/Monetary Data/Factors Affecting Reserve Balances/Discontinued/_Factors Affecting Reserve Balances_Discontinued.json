These swaps involve two transactions. First, when the foreign central bank draws on the swap line, it sells a specified amount of its currency to the Federal Reserve in exchange for dollars at the prevailing market exchange rate. The foreign currency that the Federal Reserve acquires is placed in an account for the Federal Reserve at the foreign central bank. This line in the statistical release reports the dollar value of the foreign currency held under these swaps. Second, the dollars that the Federal Reserve provides are deposited in an account for the foreign central bank at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. At the same time as the draw on the swap line, the Federal Reserve and the foreign central bank enter into a binding agreement for a second transaction in which the foreign central bank is obligated to repurchase the foreign currency at a specified future date at the same exchange rate. At the conclusion of the second transaction, the foreign central bank pays a market-based rate of interest to the Federal Reserve. Central bank liquidity swaps are of various maturities, ranging from overnight to three months.",

Repurchase agreements are transactions in which securities are purchased from a primary dealer under an agreement to sell them back to the dealer on a specified date in the future. The difference between the purchase price and the repurchase price reflects an interest payment. The Federal Reserve may enter into repurchase agreements for up to 65 business days, but the typical maturity is between one and 14 days. Federal Reserve repurchase agreements supply reserve balances to the banking system for the length of the agreement. The Federal Reserve employs a naming convention for these transactions based on the perspective of the primary dealers: the dealers receive cash while the Federal Reserve receives the collateral.",

The TALF is a facility under which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) extends loans with a term of up to five years to holders of eligible asset-backed securities. The TALF is intended to assist financial markets in accommodating the credit needs of consumers and businesses by facilitating the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by a variety of consumer and business loans. The loans provided through the TALF to eligible borrowers are non-recourse,\nmeaning that the obligation of the borrower can be discharged by surrendering the collateral to the FRBNY. The loans are extended for the market value of the security less an amount known as a haircut. As a result, the\nborrower bears the initial risk of a decline in the value of the security.\n\n\nTALF LLC is a limited liability company formed to purchase and manage any asset-backed securities received by the FRBNY in connection with the decision of a borrower not to repay a TALF loan. TALF LLC has committed, for a\nfee, to purchase all asset-backed securities received by the FRBNY in conjunction with a TALF loan at a price equal to the TALF loan plus accrued but unpaid interest. Losses on asset-backed securities held by TALF LLC\nwill be offset in the following order: by the commitment fees collected by TALF LLC, by the interest received on investments of TALF LLC, by up to $20 billion in subordinated debt funding provided by the U.S. Treasury, and\nfinally, by senior debt funding provided by the FRBNY. Payments by TALF LLC from the proceeds of its net portfolio holdings will be made in the following order: operating expenses of TALF LLC, principal due to the FRBNY, principal\ndue to the U.S. Treasury, interest due to the FRBNY, and interest due to the U.S. Treasury. Any remaining funds will be shared by the FRBNY and the U.S. Treasury.",
