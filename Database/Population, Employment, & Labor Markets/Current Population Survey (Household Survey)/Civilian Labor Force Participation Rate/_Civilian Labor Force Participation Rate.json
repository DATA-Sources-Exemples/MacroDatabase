It is provided on a monthly basis, so this data is used in part by macroeconomists as an initial economic indicator of current labor market trends. The labor force participation rate helps government agencies, financial markets, and researchers gauge the overall health of the economy. \r\n\r\nNote that long-run changes in labor force participation may reflect secular economic trends that are unrelated to the overall health of the economy. For instance, demographic changes such as the aging of population can lead to a secular increase of exits from the labor force, shrinking the labor force and decreasing the labor force participation rate. \r\n\r\nFor more information, see:\r\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, CES Overview (https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesprog.htm)\r\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Concepts and Definitions (CPS) (https://www.bls.gov/cps/definitions.htm#lfpr)"
