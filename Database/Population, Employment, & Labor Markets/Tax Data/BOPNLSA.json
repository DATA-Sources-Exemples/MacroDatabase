Rental losses are before \"passive loss\" limitation and, therefore, exceed the amount included in Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). \n\nFor additional information about the return filing requirements, see the annual reports, Statistics of Income-Individual Income Tax Returns at https://www.irs.gov/uac/soi-tax-stats-historical-data-tables."
