  "notes": "The U.S. Census Bureau provides annual estimates of income and poverty statistics for all school districts, counties, and states through the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/about.html) (SAIPE) program. The bureau's main objective with this program is to provide estimates of income and poverty for the administration of federal programs and the allocation of federal funds to local jurisdictions. In addition to these federal programs, state and local programs use the income and poverty estimates for distributing funds and managing programs.\n\nTax exemptions are one of the data sources used in producing SAIPE program estimates. This series is the algebraic operation of total exemptions(TOTEXMVA51A647NCEN (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TOTEXMVA51A647NCEN)), minus age exemptions (AGEXMVA51A647NCEN (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/AGEXMVA51A647NCEN)) for Virginia.\n\nSee more details about SAIPE Model Input Data (https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/saipe/model-tables.html)."
