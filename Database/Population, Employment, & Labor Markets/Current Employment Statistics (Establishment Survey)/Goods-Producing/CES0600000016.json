  "notes": "Indexes of aggregate weekly hours are calculated by dividing the current month's aggregate hours by the average of the 12 monthly figures, for the base year. For basic industries, the hours aggregates are the product of average weekly hours and employment of workers to which the hours apply (all employees or production and nonsupervisory employees). At all higher levels of industry aggregation, hours aggregates are the sum of the component aggregates.\n\nThe series comes from the 'Current Employment Statistics (Establishment Survey).'\n\nThe source code is: CES0600000016"
