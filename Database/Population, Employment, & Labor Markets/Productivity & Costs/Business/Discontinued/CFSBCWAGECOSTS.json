Respondents are asked to rate various aspects of business conditions along a seven-point scale ranging from \u201csubstantially increased\u201d to \u201csubstantially decreased.\u201d A series of diffusion indexes summarizing the distribution of responses is then calculated. Respondents\u2019 respective average answers to a question can be interpreted as representing their historical trends or long-run averages. Thus, zero index values indicate that, on balance, activity, hiring, capital spending, or cost pressures are growing at their trend rates or that outlooks are neutral. Positive index values indicate above-average growth (or optimistic outlooks) on balance, and negative values indicate below average growth (or pessimistic outlooks) on balance.\r\nFor more information, see https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/cfsbc/index"
