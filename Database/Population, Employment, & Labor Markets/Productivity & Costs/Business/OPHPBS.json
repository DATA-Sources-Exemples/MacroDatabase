  "notes": "The Productivity and Costs release on August 7, 2003, will reflect the June 2003 benchmark revision to payroll employment. Since employment is now reported on a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) basis, all of the historical data will be revised. Changes as a consequence of the move to NAICS should not be significant since this release carries data at high levels of aggregation."
