Six Months Are Presented Here For 1914-1915. See Original Series On \"Loans And Discounts\" And \"Individual Deposits\", Except That \"Clearing-House Exchanges\" Have Been Subtracted From The Latter. A New Classification Was Introduced For Deposits Beginning With The Call Report Of December 31, 1914. In Order To Retain Comparability, Individual Deposits Were Computed Hereon By Adding Total Demand Deposits, Of Which U.S. And Postal Savings Deposits Were Deducted, To Total Time Deposits.
