Clearing House Exchanges Were Not Subtracted Here From Individual Deposits As In The Other Four Related Series (14054, 14055, 14056, 14057), Because The Item Was Negligible. Monthly Coverage Varies From Year To Year. Except For 1874, Which Only Has Figures For October And December, All Years From 1875-1913 Have Scattered Five Month Coverage. Six Months Are Presented For 1914-1915. A New Classification Was Introducted For Deposits Beginning With The Call Report Of December 31, 1914. In Order To Retain Comparability, Individual Deposits Have Been Computed Hereon By Adding Total Demand Deposits, Of Which United States And Postal Savings Deposits Were Deducted, To Total Time Deposits.
