Six Months Are Presented For 1914-1916. See Original Series On \"Loans And Discounts\" And \"Individual Deposits\" Except That Here, \"Clearing-House Exchanges\" Has Been Deducted From The Latter. Central Reserve Cities Are New York, Chicago, And St. Louis. A New Classification For Deposits Was Introduced Beginning With The Call Report Of December 31, 1914. In Order To Retain Comparability, Individual Deposits Were Computed Hereon By Adding Total Demand Deposits, Of Which U.S. And Postal Savings Deposits Were Deducted, To Total Time Deposits.
