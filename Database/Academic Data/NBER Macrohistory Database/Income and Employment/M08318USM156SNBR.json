  "notes": "These Figures Represent The Number Of Persons Unemployed Less Than Five Weeks Expressed As The Per Cent Of The Total Civilian Labor Force (Derived By NBER). Beginning In 1960 The Data Include Alaska And Hawaii. Population Data From The 1960 Census Were Introduced In April 1962. This Resulted In A Slight Reduction In Labor Force Totals, But None In The Estimate Of Unemployment. Population Data From The 1950 Census Were Used Prior To April 1962. Source: Bureau Of Labor Statistics, \"Unemployment And Earnings\" And \"Monthly Report On The Labor Force, \" February 1967, \"Civilian Labor Force, \" And \"Unemployed Less Than Five Weeks\" For Data Through 1966 And Subsequent Issues Of The Combined Report Thereafter. Figures May Be Derived From Bls Press Releases On The Employment Situation.\n\nThis NBER data series m08318 appears on the NBER website in Chapter 8 at http://www.nber.org/databases/macrohistory/contents/chapter08.html.\n\nNBER Indicator: m08318"
