This Segment Can Be Extended Through July 1948 When The Nicb Discontinued Compilation Of Payroll Statistics. The Bureau Of Labor Statistics Segment Which Follows, Beginning In 1947 Is Not Comparable Because It Covers The Weaving Of Woolen And Worsted Fabrics Over 12 Inches Wide, While The Nicb Covers The Spinning Of Woolen And Worsted Yarns As Well As Fabrics (See Nicb Research Report No. 69, 1924, P. 57). In The Bls Classification, Woolen Yarn Mills Are Not Segregated From Those Spinning Yarn From Cotton, Silk, Rayon, Or Other Fibers; And The Weaving Of Woolen And Worsted Fabrics Of Narrower Than 12 Inch Widths Is Not Treated Seperately But Combined With That Of Other Materials.
