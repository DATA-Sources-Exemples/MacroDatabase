In January, 1910 Textile Industry Data Were Extended To Include All Classes Of Labor, Rather Than Only Highly Skilled One As Heretofore. The Cloakmakers Strike In New York City Involved Nearly 10% Of All Workers Reporting. The Figures For July And August Are Given Excluding Them. Beginning In January 1912, Lake Seamen, Who Have A Very High Rate Of Unemployment During The Winter Months, Are Not Included. Beginning In June, 1915 The Date Was Changed From The Last Of The Month To The 15Th.
