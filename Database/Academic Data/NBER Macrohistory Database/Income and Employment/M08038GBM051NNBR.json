  "notes": "Data From 1895-1909 Refer To The Average Number Of Days Worked Per Week During The Month, Based On 4 Weeks. Data Beginning In 1910 Refer To The Average Number Of Days Worked Per Week For One Fortnight Per Month -- Sometimes The First Two Weeks Of The Month, Sometimes The Last Two Weeks. Data Include Iron Ore And Ironstone Mines And Openworks. Data For May-November, 1898 Are Affected By Employment In Scotland. The Drop In March, 1912 Is The Result Of A General Coal Mining Stoppage. Beginning In 1920 It Is Assumed That Data Refer Only To Mines In Great Britain. A General Coal Mining Stoppage Occured In October, 1920. Employment Is Low In May-December, 1926 Primarily As The Result Of The Decreased Demand For Iron Ore At Iron Ore And Steel Works Due To A Shortage Of Fuel. Most Of The Mines Were Closed Down During May And By The End Of The Month The Industry Was Almost At A Total Standstill. Coal Mining Disputes Affected Mining During Subsequent Months.
