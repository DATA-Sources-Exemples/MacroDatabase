This Segment Is Roughly Comparable To The Previous One In Industry Coverage. However, It Includes In Addition Gray And Malleable Iron Foundries And Power Boilers. It Is Discontinued In July 1949, And The New Industry Classification Adopted Has Considerably Affected The Continuity Of These Data. Since There Is No Group Covering The Entire Iron And Steel Industry, It Has Been Tried To Derive A Representative Series From A Number Of Components (See Worksheets). No Indexes Are Compiled By The Bls For These Revised Series Which Represent The Number Of Production Workers.
