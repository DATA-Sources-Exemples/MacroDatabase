  "notes": "The Enomorous Rise In August, 1933 Is Attributable To Premature Announcement Of The Cwa Program. It Was Not Sustained In Following Months As Supplementary Announcements Of The Program'S Delay Discouraged Registration. Beginning November, 1933, Data Include Applicants Registered For Cwa, Pwa, And Other Governmental Programs, Excluding Cook County. The Increase In March-April, 1934 Is Due To The Demobilization Of Cwa. The Increase In October 1934 Reflects The Drive To Register Applicants By The Relief Commission And The State Employment Service.
