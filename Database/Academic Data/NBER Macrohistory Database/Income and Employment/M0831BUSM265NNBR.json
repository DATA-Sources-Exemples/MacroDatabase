  "notes": "Series Is Presented Here As Two Variables--(1)--Original Data, 1920-1948 (2)--Original Data, 1947-1959. The Bls Series Is Believed Not To Be Comparable To The Nicb Data, Since It Covers Only The Weaving Of Woolen And Worsted Fabrics Over 12 Inches Wide, While The Nicb Series Covers The Spinning Of Woolen And Worsted Yarns As Well As The Weaving And Finishing Of Woolen And Worsted Fabrics (See Nicb, Research Report, No. 69,\"Wages, Hours, And Employment In American Manufacturing Industries, 1924, P. 57). In The Current Bls Classification, Woolen Yarn Mills Are Not Segregated From Those Spinning Yarn From Cotton, Silk, Rayon Or Other Fibers; And The Weaving Of Woolen And Worsted Fabrics Of Narrower Than 12\" Widths Is Not Treated Separately, But Combined With That Of Other Materials. For 1951 On, The Figures Have Been Rounded And No Fractions Of Cents Are Available In The Source.
