  "notes": "This Series, Computed By The Icc, Represents The Total Number Of Employees (Including Executives And Officials, Professional, Clerical, Maintenance Of Way, And Transportation Groups) On Class I Steam Railways (Excluding Switching And Terminal Companies). The Index Is Computed By Relating The Number Of Employees As Of The Middle Of Each Month To The Number In The Base Period Which Was 1,786,258. In Adjusting The Index For Seasonal Variation, The \"Ratio-To-Moving-Average\" Method (12 Months) Was Used (Using Data For The Period 1924-1932). If Any Railways Are Either Added To Or Dropped From Class I Classification, Data For Such Roads Are Either Included Or Excluded As The Case May Be, But No Change Is Made In The Base Figure Used In Computing The Index. See Source And 1942 Supplement.
