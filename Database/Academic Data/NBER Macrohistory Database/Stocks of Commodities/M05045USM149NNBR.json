  "notes": "Data Cover Stocks At Cottonseed Oil Mills, Refineries And Consuming Etablishments, And In Transit To Refineries And Consumers. Beginning In July 1949 About 1000 Small Producers And Consumers Were Excused From Filing Monthly Reports. They Filed Instead On An Annual Basis. Their Number Increased To About 1500 Since 1949, But Their Elimination Had No Significant Effect On The Data. For Items Affected By More Than One Per Cent, Figures Were Adjusted To An Estimated 100 Per Cent In The Monthly Publications, On The Basis Of Past Records Of Those Plants. They Were Revised In The Annual Summaries On The Basis Of The Figures Reported Annually.
