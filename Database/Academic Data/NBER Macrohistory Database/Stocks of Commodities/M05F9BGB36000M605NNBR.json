  "notes": "Series Is Presented Here As Two Variables--(1)--Original Data, 1879-1896 (2)--Original Data, 1895-1916. There May Be Some Element Of Seasonal Variation In This Variable But It Is Obscured By Large Cyclical Movements. A Strike In August-September 1896 Accounts For The Decrease. The Figure For December 1903 Comes From The Iron And Coal Trades Review, January 1, 1904, As The Economists Appears To Have Misprinted It As 10,040. The Iron And Coal Trades Review Was Also Used For Data In April 1907, Febuary And November Of 1910, And November And December Of 1914. End Of Month Figures Were Derived By Taking The Figure From The Iron And Coal Trades Review For The Week Ending Nearest To The End Of The Respective Months.
