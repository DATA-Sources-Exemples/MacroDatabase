  "notes": "The Original Source (\"Lake Superior Iron Ores\") Gives Only Total Stocks Of Lake Superior Ore, But This Series Together With Series 05015 (Iron Ore Stocks At Furnaces) Adds Up To The Totals (Series 05107) Except For Small Rounding Discrepancies. The Figure For March 1928 Was Revised To 5.35 From 5.24 (As Given In The Survey Of Current Business) To Correspond To The Revised Total Shown In The Source. The Discrepancy Between The Revised And The Scb Figure Was Allotted To This Series As Well As Series 05015 By Adding 1/3 Of It (0.017) To Series 05106 And 2/3 (0.215) To Series 05015. The Figure For April 1932 (5.56) Was Taken From The Original Source; The Scb Shows 5.52.
