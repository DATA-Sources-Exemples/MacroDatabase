These Figures Represent Total Storage Holdings Of Lard At Factories As Well As Warehouses (Excluding Lard Held By Retailers). Refrigerated Storage Is Included, But Cannot Be Segregated. Figures Refer To Rendered Lard (Including Neutral Lard And Rendered Pork Fat); From 1949 On Refined Lard (Federally Inspected) Is Available, But Has Been Excluded From These Data. Prior To 1949 There Was No Distinction Between The Two Categories And According To The Source Rendered Lard May Have Included Certain Quantities Of \"Refined\" Lard In This Segment. After 1954 The Source Shows One Figure For The Combined Holdings Of Rendered And Refined Lard.
