  "notes": "Round Bales Are Counted As Half Bales. Running Bales Are Of Varying Weight, Depending On The Ginnery Itself. Linters Are Not Included, But Part Stocks Are. Data For 1912-July 1925 Were Computed By NBER By Adding Stocks In Cotton Growing States And In \"All Others.\" Thereafter, Data Are Given In Total By The Source. Data Were Checked From The Record Book, Part 1, P. 22 (The Record Book For 1912 Includes Linters And Was Not Comparable) And The Survey Of Current Business. After 1949, Reports On Cotton Were No Longer Made On A Calendar Month Basis, But For Four Or Five Week Periods. Therefore, Beginning In January 1950, The Figures Refer To The Saturday Near The End Of The Month, Up To And Including The Fourth Day Of The Following Month.
