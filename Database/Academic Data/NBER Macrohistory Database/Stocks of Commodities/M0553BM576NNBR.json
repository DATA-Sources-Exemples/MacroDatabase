  "notes": "Series Is Presented Here As Two Variables--(1)--Original Data, 1923-1941 (2)--Original Data, 1938-1955. Figures For December 1939-December 1941 Were Derived By Deducting Government Stocks Shown In The Source (Rubber Statistical Bulletin) From Totals Shown In The Survey Of Current Business. Beginning In 1942, Government Stocks Are Not Shown Separately Until June 1947. The October 1948 Rubber Statistical Bulletin Shows December 1946 And June 1947. According To The Department Of Commerce, Office Of Business Economics, No Information On Government Stocks Is Available At All. However, The Totals Covering Both Industry -- Manufacturers, Dealers, Importers -- And Government Stocks In The Rubber Statistical Bulletin Agree With The Scb Totals; Thus The Government Stocks Shown There Were Derived From The Totals In Order To Obtain Two More Years On A Comparable Basis.
