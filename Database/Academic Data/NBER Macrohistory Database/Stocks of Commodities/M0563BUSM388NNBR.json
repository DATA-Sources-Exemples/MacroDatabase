  "notes": "Series Is Presented Here As Two Variables--(1)--Original Data, 1916-1929 (2)--Original Data, 1929-1955. This Variable, Covering \"Total Industry\" Has Been Reduced To The Level Of The 1916-1928 Variable Covering 192 Mills On The Basis Of Their Average Monthly Relationship In The Overlapping Years 1929. The Ratio Used Is .3563. Beginning With 1942, The Data Are Not Entirely Comparable With The Data For 1929-1941, Due To The Undercoverage In The Census Canvas Of Mills In The Eastern States Prior To 1942. Information Is Not Available On The Extent Of Incompleteness In The Census Figures For Southern Pine Prior To 1942, But Since Monthly Figures Are Adjusted To Annual Census Totals, The Figures Through 1941 Reflect The Census Undercoverage (See Scb, 1953 Statistical Supplement, P. 272.)
