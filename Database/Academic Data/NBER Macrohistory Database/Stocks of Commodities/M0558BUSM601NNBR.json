Data Cover Only Domestic Ore Until At Least 1939, Except For 1934, When, According To The American Zinc Institute Office, There Was A Change In The Segregation Of Foreign And Domestic Ore. Some Foreign Ore Was Included In The 1934 Data, But Because The Amount Was So Small, Figures Were Not Changed (Except For December 1934 -- The Figure Was Changed From 119.8 To 118.0 To Exclude Foreign Ore Altogether.) Beginning In 1940, Stocks Produced From Foreign Ore Are Included (See The Scb, October 1941 And Earlier 1941 Issues.) At The End Of 1942, Previously Unreported Stocks Were Added, And The Figures Beginning In 1943 Are Not Considered Comparable With Those For Preceding Years (See Scb, 1947 Supplement, P. 258, And Others).
