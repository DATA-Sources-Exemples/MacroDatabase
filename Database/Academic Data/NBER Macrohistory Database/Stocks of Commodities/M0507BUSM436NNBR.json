  "notes": "Series 05007 Is Presented Here As Two Variables--(1)--Original Data, 1917-1946 (2)--Original Data, 1946-1956. Lard Stocks Are Included And Cover Total Storage Of Lard At Factories And Warehouses (Excluding Lard Held By Retailers); Refrigerated Storage Holdings Are Included, But Cannot Be Segregated. Beginning In 1949, Refined Lard Was Added To Stocks Of Lard. Prior To 1949, Only Stocks Of Rendered Lard (Including Neutral Lard And Rendered Pork Fat) Had Been Reported, But Since There Was No Distinction Between\"Rendered\" And \"Refined\" It Is Assumed, According To The Source, That Figures Prior To 1949 May Have Included Certain Quantities Of\"Refined\" Lard Stocks. This Variable Ends In 1956, As Coverage Changed In January 1957.
