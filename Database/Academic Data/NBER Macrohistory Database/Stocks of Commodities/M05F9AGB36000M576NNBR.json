  "notes": "Series Is Presented Here As Two Variables--(1)--Original Data, 1879-1896 (2)--Original Data, 1895-1916. Data From 1882-September 1896 Include Makers' Stores And Stocks In Public Warehouses. Thereafter, They Represent Stocks In Connal'S Store Only, Makers' Stocks No Longer Being Published. When In The Source, Gaps Occurred Or Obvious Misprints Were Given, Data Were Taken From The Iron And Coal Trades Review, Though Not Absolutely Comparable, But Practically So. The Iron And Coal Trades Review Gave Figures For The End Of The Week (The Last Week In The Month Is Taken Here), While The Economist Data Are For The Last Day Of The Month. In The 1893 Issue The Figures Were Entirely Different, But The Figures Reported Here Seem More Accurate. A Strike In 1892 Accounts For The Decrease In September Of That Year. Source: Data For 1879-November 1881: The Colliery Guardian; Data For December 1881-1896: The London Economist, Monthly Trade Supplements\n\nThis NBER data series m05019a appears on the NBER website in Chapter 5 at http://www.nber.org/databases/macrohistory/contents/chapter05.html.\n\nNBER Indicator: m05019a"
