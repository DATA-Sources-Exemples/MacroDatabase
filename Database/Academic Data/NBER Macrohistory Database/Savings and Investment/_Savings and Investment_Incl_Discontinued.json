    "notes": "Joint Stock Companies Formed And Registered Between 1862-1900 Are Often Described As Limited Stock Companies. The First Date Of Registration Was July 17, 1856. The Law Of 1858 Extended The Law'S Coverage To Banks. The Raw Figure For July 1859 Includes One Firm Whose Registration Was Later Transferred To Ireland. The First Number Assigned Under The Companies Act Of 1862, Was 2,269 On November 3, 1862. There Had Been Three Companies Registered On November 1 Under The Companies Acts Of 1856 And 1857, When The New Law, The Companies Act Of 1862 (25-26 Vict. C. 89, See Folder Page) Went Into Effect. The Law Of 1867 Made Requirements More Strict. A Page Is Missing From The Record: June 11, 1869 Had The Number Ten And July 14, 1869 Had Number Forty-Six (Unadjusted Figures.) The Law Of 1879 Encouraged Banks To Join. The Law Of 1890 Made Company Expansion Easier. The Finance Act Of 1899 Imposed A Higher Registration Fee.
