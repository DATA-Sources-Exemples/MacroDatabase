The \"Stocks\" And \"Bonds And Notes\" Series Taken From Ayre'S Were Summed And Checked Against The \"Total\" Series. Where Discrepancies Occurred, Recourse Was Made To The Journal Of Commerce For The Correct Figures. For 1906, No Such Check Could Be Made Because Of The Unavailability Of Source And The Sum Does Not Equal The \"Total.\" For Inclusions, See The \"Total\" Series. Source: L.P.
