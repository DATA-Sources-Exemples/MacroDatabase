  "notes": "The Months Of January And June 1946, October And November 1949, June-August 1952, And July-September, 1956 Have Been Revised To Modify The Effects Of Various Steel Strikes. As Pointed Out By The Source, Steel Fabrication Continues During Strikes From Inventories In The Hands Of Fabricators. Since Ingot Steel Production Represents Steel Activity In This Index, The Effect Of Strikes Is Overstated And Therefore The Federal Reserve Index Of Metal Fabricating Was Used For Those Months In Which Steel Ingot Production Does Not Adequately Represent Steel Industry Activity.
