Data Were Computed By NBER By Summing Figures For The Paris Metropolitan, Le Chemin De Fer Electrique Sauterrain Nord-Sud De Paris, And The Service Central. The Service Central Began Operation In March Of 1930. The Impact Of This Addition Is So Small, However, That The Variables For 1910-1931 And 1930-1938 May Be Treated As One Continuous Variable. Data Were Checked By NBER With Figures Provided Directly From The Paris Metropolitain And The \"Annuaire Statistique De La Ville De Paris\", 1910 And Following Volumes. Source: Rapport Du Conseil D'Administration, Compagnie Du Chemin De Fer Metropolitain De Paris, 1931 And Following Years.\n\nThis NBER data series m03012ec appears on the NBER website in Chapter 3 at http://www.nber.org/databases/macrohistory/contents/chapter03.html.\n\nNBER Indicator: m03012ec"
