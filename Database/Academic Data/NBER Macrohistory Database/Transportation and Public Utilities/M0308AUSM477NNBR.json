  "notes": "Series 03008 Is Presented Here As Two Variables--(1)--Original Data, 1907-1930 (2)--Original Data, 1915-1917. Data Include All Car Requisitions Including Duplication, Therefore \"Requisitions\" Is Possibly A Better Term Than \"Shortages\". For Example A Shipper Might Request 25 Cars From Four Lines, However, Only Needing 25. This Data Would Show A 100 Car \"Shortage\" In This Example. The Railroads Included In These Reports Are The Same Throughout, Except That The Actual Number Of Roads Decreased Due To Consolidation From About 175 To 118. Data Throughout Are Comparable. Data For 1915 Are Based On End-Of-Month Figures. Data Are Converted To Middle-Of-Month By Taking Two Month Moving Averages.
