  "notes": "Data Reported To The Rubber Manufacturers' Association (Rma) Were Raised To Industry Totals By Them. Shipments Include Only Tubes Forwarded To Purchasers; Those Forwarded To Warehouses, Branches, Or On A Consignment Basis Are Included In Stocks Figures. Federal Excise Tax Went Into Effect June 30, 1932. The Heavy Shipments Were Undoubtedly Taken To Escape The Tax And Resultant Price Rise. According To The Rma, Figures For The Year 1942 Were Published Only\"So That There Will Be No Break In The Continuity Of Tube Statistics.\" In That Year, Dealers Made Large Returns Of Manufacturers Of Stocks Originally Intended For Export, Because Of Government Restrictions; Shipments Were Not Adjusted For These Returns (See Table Of\"Total U.S.A. Automotive Inner Tubes, Shipments, Production And Inventory,\" Compiled By The Statistical And Accounting Department Of The Rma). Beginning In 1951, Data For Motorcycle Tubes Are Included.
