By 1954, The Number Of Such Firms Had Grown To About 1500. Monthly Figures For Such Plants Are Estimated On The Basis Of The Performance In The Preceeding Year, And Significant Discrepencies Between Estimated And Reported Annual Totals Are Adjusted In The Annual Issues Of \"Animal And Vegetable Fats And Oils\" (Source, Introduction). Beginning With January 1955, Figures For Inedible Tallow Were Combined With Figures For Grease, Other Than Wool (See\"Fats And Oils, Series M17-1-15, For January 1955).
