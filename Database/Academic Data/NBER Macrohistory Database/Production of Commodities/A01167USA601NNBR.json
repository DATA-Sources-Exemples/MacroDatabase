For The Year 1906-1911 The Data Were Compiled From \"Engineering And Mining Journal.\" The Changes In Reported Plant Capacities As Of The End Of 1940 Reflect Recalculations Rather Than Any Changes In Physical Plant. This May Also Hold True In Respect To Prior Years (See Yearbook Of The American Bureau Of Business Statistics, 1941-1944 Issues). Data For 1943-1946 Include Electrolyc Refining Capacity Plus Lake Superior And Fire-Refined. The Year Ends On December 31.
