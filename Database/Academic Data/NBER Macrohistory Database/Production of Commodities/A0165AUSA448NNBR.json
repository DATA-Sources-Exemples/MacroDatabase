Data Are For The Calculated 308-Day Capacity Of All Mines That Operate For Any Part Of The Yeaar, Including New Mines. Data Found In Source On Basis Of 280 Work Days A Year. Estimates Have Nothing To Do With Known Reserves, But Simply Represent Potential Production For An Arbitrarily Chosen Number Of Days Per Year. This Series Is Reprinted In Mineral Yearbook, 1945, P.834 On The Basis O Of 280 Working Days, And 261 Working Days (5-Day Work Week) A Year.
