  "notes": "In The Source, This Series Is Called \"Estimated Annual Potential Production Of Coke In By-Product Ovens When Operated At 100% Of Maximum Capacity. NBER Treated This Series As Representing Fiscal Years Ending On June 30 In Their Analysis. The Indicated Increase From December 31, 1922 To December 31, 1923 Is Because Of An Upward Revision Of The Rated Capacity Of Certain Plants As Reported By The Operators To The Geologic Survey. While The Annual Figures Through 1939 Were Based On Daily Figures Multiplied By 365 (366 In Leap Years) The 1940 Figure (59,394,070 Tons) Was Obtained Through A Special Survey (See Minerals Yearbook 1940, P.870) And Is Probably Not Quite Comparable To Earlier Data. The Corrected Figure Used In This Data Was Obtained By Multiplying Daily Capacity Of 170,467 Tons With 366. 1941 And Following Years, Included Here, Are Not Entirely Comparable With The Series Through 1940. Source: Mineral Resources, Part Ii; Minerals Yearbook, Successive Issues.\n\nThis NBER data series a01166 appears on the NBER website in Chapter 1 at http://www.nber.org/databases/macrohistory/contents/chapter01.html.\n\nNBER Indicator: a01166"
