In September 1938 The Seperate Classification Of Reorganization Cases Was Discontinued, Subsequent To Elimination Of Paragraph 77-B From The National Bankruptcy Act, And The Data Were Revised Accordingly Back To June 1934 (See Dun'S Statistical Review, February 1939). This Segment Ends Due To A Revision Of March 1940, Effected By Change To A More Complete Coverage Of Voluntary Discontinuances With Losses To Creditors And Of Small Failures Not Previously Covered By Dun And Bradstreet (See Source, March 1940). Source: Dun And Bradstreet, Inc., Data For 1934-January 1937: Dun And Bradstreet Monthly Review; Data For February 1937-1939: Dun'S Statistical Review; Data For This Variable Are Also Available In Survey Of Current Business, December 1938 And Supplement For 1940.\n\nThis NBER data series m09030b appears on the NBER website in Chapter 9 at http://www.nber.org/databases/macrohistory/contents/chapter09.html.\n\nNBER Indicator: m09030b"
