In September, 1938 The Separate Classification Of Reorganization Cases Was Discontinued, Subsequent To Elimination Of Paragraph 77-B From The National Bankruptcy Act, And The Data Were Revised Accordingly Back To June, 1934 (See Dun'S Statistical Review, February, 1939). This Segment Ends Due To A Revision Of March 1940, Effected By Change To A More Complete Coverage Of Voluntary Discontinuances With Losses To Creditors And Of Small Failures Not Previously Covered By Dun And Bradstreet (See Source, March, 1940). Source: Data For 1934-August, 1937: Survey Of Current Business, December 1938; Data For September, 1937-1939: Dun And Bradstreet, Inc., Dun'S Statistical Review.\n\nThis NBER data series m09034b appears on the NBER website in Chapter 9 at http://www.nber.org/databases/macrohistory/contents/chapter09.html.\n\nNBER Indicator: m09034b"
