  "notes": "Series Is Presented Here As Three Variables--(1)--Original Data, 1894-1938 (2)--Original Data, 1934-1939 (3)--Original Data, 1939-1958. Beginning With February 7, 1914 And Continuing For The Next Three Years, The 1913 Figures Are Omitted And Earlier Years Are Moved One Year Ahead. For Example, During 1914 The 1912 Figures Are Published As Those For 1913, The 1911 Figures As 1912, And The 1910 Figures As 1911. These Errors Were Made Only In The Number Of Trading Failures. The Totals For All Failures Were Based On Correct Figures And Therefore Do Not Check During This Period. Beginning In 1934, Failures In Wholesale And Retail Trade Are Added In Order To Continue The Series As Before. A Slight Change In Coverage Of The Data Occured As Compared To The Former Group Trading Companies (For Revised Figures, See Source, March,1936). Source: R G. Dun And Co.(Dun And Bradstreet, Inc. After March, 1933), Data For 1894-February, 1933: Dun'S Review; Data For March, 1933-January, 1937: Dun Bradstreet Monthly Review; Data For February, 1937-1938: Dun'S Statistical Review.\n\nThis NBER data series m09031a appears on the NBER website in Chapter 9 at http://www.nber.org/databases/macrohistory/contents/chapter09.html.\n\nNBER Indicator: m09031a"
