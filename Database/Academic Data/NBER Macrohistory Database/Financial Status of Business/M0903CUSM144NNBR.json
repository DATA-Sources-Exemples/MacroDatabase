Beginning With January, 1949 Monthly Report (Back Data Given For 1948) About 60 Companies Which Previously Reported On A Voluntary Basis Have Been Omitted. Based On Annual Operating Revenues, The Reduction In The Number Of Companies Affects The Comparability Of The Data By Less Than 3% (See The Mimeographed Note On \"Revisions Of The Monthly Telephone Statistics\" (Undated, No. 35573) By The F.C.C., Supplementing The January, 1949 Issue Of The \"Operating Data From Monthly Reports Of 53 Domestic Telephone Carriers Which File Annual And Monthly Reports,\" F.C.C. (See Also The Survey Of Current Business, October, 1949, Pp. 5-23). From 1952 And Thereafter, Hawaii And Puerto Rico Are Included. The Number Of Companies (NBER Series 09003) Reporting Monthly To The F.C.C. Varies From About 58 (1952) To 38 (1954-1956) To 42 (1957 And Following). This Affects The Figures Very Little, And The Series Is Considered To Be Comparable. Data After March, 1959 Is Subject To Revision. April And May, 1959 Figures Are Adjusted To One More Decimal. Classifications, This Variable Is Not Comparable To The Interstate Commerce Commission Series Of Operating Income, Except For 1932 Through May, 1934.
