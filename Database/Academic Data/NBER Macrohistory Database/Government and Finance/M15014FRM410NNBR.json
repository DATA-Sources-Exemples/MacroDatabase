  "notes": "Data Are Listed In Source Under \"Budget De L'Etat-Timbre Proportionnel--Effects Negotiable Au Mon, Warrants, Billets De Banque.\" Data Were Repeated In Source The Following Year And Thus Double-Checked. Discrepancies Were Settled By Summing Component Parts Of A Total Or By Successive Cumulative Totals. The Raw Figure For April 1924 (13808) Was Misprinted By The Source As 13308. The Cumulative Total In 1924 And 1925 For May 1924 Is Also Probably A Misprint. Only Quarterly Data Is Available For April-June, 1934.
