  "notes": "For 1894-1933, The Data Are For \"General Imports\". For 1934-1941, The Data Are For \"Imports For Consumption\". This Series Is Treated As Being Continuous, But For Details Please See The Notes Below. This Series Of Lead Imports Was Shown Separately Beginning In March, 1894. The Series Was Named \"Lead And Lead Content Imports\". The Series Was Named \"Lead In Ore\" Beginning In July, 1897. It Was Also Called\"Imports Of Lead (Pigs, Bars, Old, And Other In Ore)\" As Well As\"Lead And In Ore, Etc\". Beginning In July, 1900, The Series Was Called \"Lead In Ore And Base Bullion\". Beginning In July, 1909, The Series Was Called \"Lead In Ore, Bullion, And Base Bullion\". The Change In Name Beginning In July, 1897 Does Not Greatly Affect The Comparability Of The Series. This Can Be Seen By Comparing The Import Figures Of The Two Following Years. Under The Heading Of\"Lead In Ore, Etc.\" The Figure For June-July 1897/8 Was 181.66. Under The Heading Of \"Pigs, Bars, And Old\" The Figure For June-July 1897/8 Was 3.31. The Figures For The Two Headings For June-July 1898/9 Were 195.93 And 0.45, Respectively. Beginning In July, 1910, The Series Was Called \"Lead Ore, Lead Content, Lead In Other Ore, Bullion And Base Bullion\". Lead In Other Ore Was Excluded Prior To July, 1910. Beginning In October, 1913, Lead In Other Ore Is Included In Lead Ore. Beginning In October, 1922, The Series Was Called \"Lead Ore, Matte, Bullion, And Base Bullion\". Unrevised Figures Are Given Beginning In December, 1931. An NBER Note Accompanying Data For 1933 Reads \"(Excludes Imports For Smelting, Refining, And Export--For This Year Only)?\" (N.B. Note That The Question Mark Was Added To The Note By NBER). Beginning With January, 1934 The Data Are For Imports For Consumption Only. This Includes Imports Going Into Immediate Consumption Plus Withdrawals From Bonded Warehouses. Beginning In 1936, The Data Includes Some \"Pigs And Bars\" And \"Reclaimed \"Reclaimed Scrap, Dross And Lead, N.S.P.F., Except Antinomial Lead\", Whose Figures Are Lumped With Ore And Bullion In The Item For \"For Smelting, Refining, And Export\". However, \"Pigs And Bars\" And \"Reclaimed Scrap\", Etc. Are Relatively Unimportant In This Item. See The Series Description \"Imports Of Lead (Ore, Matte, Bullion, And Base Bullion)\".
