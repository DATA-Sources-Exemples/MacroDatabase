  "notes": "The World Uncertainty Index determines uncertainty using the frequency of the selfsame word in the quarterly Economist Intelligence Unit country reports. This smoothed version of the index is preferred over the index for country-level data. The 3-quarter weighted moving average is computed as follows: 1996Q4 = (1996Q4*0.6) + (1996Q3*0.3) + (1996Q2*0.1)/3.\n\nPlease see Hites Ahir, Nicholas Bloom and Davide Furceri (2018), 'The World Uncertainty Index' (https://www.policyuncertainty.com/media/WUI_mimeo_10_29.pdf) for additional explanation."
