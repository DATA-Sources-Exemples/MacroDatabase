As explained in the introductory text, pp. 8 and 10 (https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/scribd/?item_id=6408&filepath=%2Fdocs%2Fpublications%2Fbms%2F1914-1941%2FBMS14-41_complete.pdf&start_page=1), they are subject to some change when a tabulation is made of figures for individual noninsured banks.\n\nBanks in United States possessions are excluded except one national bank in Alaska; which was a member of the Federal Reserve System from the time it opened for business in April 1915 until it was placed in voluntary liquidation in April 1921 and which in June 1919 hud total deposits of $351,000.\n\nFor more information, see Table 1 at https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/scribd/?item_id=6408&filepath=%2Fdocs%2Fpublications%2Fbms%2F1914-1941%2FBMS14-41_complete.pdf&start_page=1"
