  "notes": "Average weekly wages are the wages paid by unemployment insurance covered employers during the calendar quarter, regardless of when the services were performed. Included in wages are pay for vacation and other paid leave, bonuses, stock options, tips, the cash value of meals and lodging, and in some States, contributions to deferred compensation plans (such as 401(k) plans). \n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis seasonally adjusts this series by using the 'x12' package from R with default parameter settings. The package uses the U.S. Bureau of the Census X-12-ARIMA Seasonal Adjustment Program. More information on the 'x12' package can be found at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/x12/x12.pdf.
