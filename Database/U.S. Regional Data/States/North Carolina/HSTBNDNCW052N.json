  "notes": "The data consists of weekly observations of prices for North Carolina 6 percent bonds traded in New York City as reported in the \"Notes on the Money Market\" section of The Bankers' Magazine and Statistical Register from January 1855 through December 1865. The series may be incomplete due to various limitations in price reporting during the sample period. Available prices were reported for seven-day intervals prior to January 1862 and for ten-day intervals afterwards. The New York Times' summary of daily trading on the New York Stock Exchange was used to complete the series in the best possible manner. The New York Times-reported price that occurred closest to but not beyond the date listed in the Bankers'Magazine was used.\n\nOne should not infer the maturity or the issue dates of the bonds from the available prices. The holding period yields or yields to maturity imputed from this data should be interpreted with caution. Such information must be sought from other sources on state finances."
