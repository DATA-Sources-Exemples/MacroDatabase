Those annual changes are then multiplied (chained) together, forming the chained-type index time series. Chain-type indexes or chain-dollar estimates are used when you want to show how output or spending has changed over time. The percent changes in quantity indexes exactly match the percent changes in chained dollars, so they can be used interchangeably for making comparisons. Real estimates remove the effects of price changes, which can obscure changes in output or spending in current dollars.\n\nFor more information about this release go to http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_metro/gdp_metro_newsrelease.htm.",

The new methodology uses the latest and most accurate data mapping of listing statuses to yield a cleaner and more consistent measurement of active listings at both the national and local level. The methodology has also been adjusted to better account for missing data in some fields including square footage. Most areas across the country will see minor changes with a smaller handful of areas seeing larger updates. As a result of these changes, the data released since December 2021 will not be directly comparable with previous data releases (files downloaded before December 2021) and Realtor.com\u00ae economics blog posts. However, future data releases, including historical data, will consistently apply the new methodology. More details are available at the source's Real Estate Data Library (https://www.realtor.com/research/data/).",
