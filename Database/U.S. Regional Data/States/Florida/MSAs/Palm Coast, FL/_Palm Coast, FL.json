A single-family home or house types include fully detached, semidetached (semidetached, side-by-side), row houses, and townhouses. For attached units, each must be separated from the adjacent unit by a ground-to-roof wall in order to be classified as a single-family structure. These units also must not share heating/air-conditioning systems or utilities. Units built on top of one another and those built side-by-side that do not have a ground-to-roof wall and/or have common facilities (i.e., attic, basement, heating plant, plumbing, etc.) are not included under single-family structures.\n\nThe Saint Louis Federal Reserve Bank uses the most recent Metropolitan Statistical Area definitions released by the Office of Management and Budget.
