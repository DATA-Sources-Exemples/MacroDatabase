  "notes": "As a result of reconfiguration of the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 databases to fit NAICS naming conventions, this data is tracked by two nearly identical series. The other series for this data can be found at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU72324206561000001SA. If you feel the differences between the two series would be meaningful to your application, contact the Bureau of Labor Statistics for guidance.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis seasonally adjusts this series by using the 'x12' package from R with default parameter settings. The package uses the U.S. Bureau of the Census X-12-ARIMA Seasonal Adjustment Program. More information on the 'x12' package can be found at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/x12/x12.pdf. More information on X-12-ARIMA can be found at https://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/."
