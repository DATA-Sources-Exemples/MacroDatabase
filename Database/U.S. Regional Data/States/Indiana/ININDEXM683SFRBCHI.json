  "notes": "This series represents the contributions of Indiana to the Midwest Economy Index (MEI). This series is the weighted average of state variables measuring the growth in nonfarm business activity based on indicators of four broad sectors of the Indiana's economy: 1) manufacturing, 2) construction and mining, 3) services, and 4) consumer spending.\n\nA zero value represents an average contribution to the MEI by the state of Indiana, whereas a positive value indicates that an above-average contribution to MEI; and negative values indicate below-average contribution to MEI.\n\nFor further information about the Midwest Economy Index, go to http://midwest.chicagofedblogs.org/archives/2011/03/mei_by_scott_br.html and http://chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/chicago_fed_letter/2010/cflnovember2010_280.pdf."
