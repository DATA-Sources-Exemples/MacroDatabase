    "notes": "Overview of the Index\nThe Index is a quarterly comprehensive picture of the average American household\u2019s financial condition. Built by assessing the key elements of financial health and distress, it converts a complex set of factors into a single, easy to understand number.\n\nScope and History\nThe index measures the U.S., all 50 states and more than 70 MSAs. The national and state versions date back to 1980 and the MSA versions date back to 1990.\n\nPublic Data and Proprietary Methodology\nWe use more than 65 data points from government, public and private data and a proprietary methodology for compiling, combining and evaluating data. With nearly 50 years of experience and insight into helping consumers in financial distress, we know the biggest causes of distress, how people react to financial challenges and proven strategies for regaining control. (Note: Our client data is not a data source for the Index)\n\nMeasured on a 100 Point Scale\nFinancial distress is measured on a 100 point scale and a score under 70 indicates financial distress. The lower the score equals more distress, a weaker financial position, more urgency to act, takes longer and is harder to resolve, and increases the probability of needing a third party help to resolve.\n\nThe Index score is tied to one of 5 general rating categories, which reflect the strength and stability of the consumer\u2019s position.\nLess than 60 Emergency / Crisis\n60 \u2013 69 Distressed / Unstable\n70 \u2013 79 Weakening / At-Risk\n80 \u2013 89 Good / Stable\n90 and Above Excellent / Secure\n\nWhat Does the Index Measure?\nWe measure the 5 categories of personal finance that reflect or lead to a secure, stable financial life\u2014Employment, Housing, Credit, Household Budget and Net Worth. All are equally important, so have given each category equal weighting.\n\nEmployment. Stable income is the foundation of any family\u2019s finances. This category measures the impact of unemployment and underemployment on financial health.\nKey Measures: Unemployment, Underemployment\nSample Data Source: Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nHousing. Safe, affordable housing is a priority for all families. This category measures how consumers are paying their mortgage/rent and the impact of housing costs on their finances.\nKey Measures: Mortgage and Rental Delinquencies, Housing as Percent of Budget\nSample Data Source: National Delinquency Survey\n\nCredit. Responsible use of credit creates more borrowing options and lower costs. This category assesses the strength of credit scores and how well families manage their credit.\nKey Measures: Credit Scores, Trade Line Utilization, Credit Delinquencies, Per Capita Bankruptcies\nSample Data Source: National Credit Bureau\n\nHousehold Budget. Spending less than you make is the daily choice that leads to long-term success. This category measures families\u2019 spending patterns and saving for emergencies.\nKey Measures: Disposable Income, Savings, Consumer Confidence\nSample Data Source: Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nNet Worth. Strong, positive net worth creates options and independence. This category measures how well consumers are strengthening their personal balance sheets.\nKey Measures: Household Net Worth, Net Worth versus Funds Required for Long-Term Needs (e.g. retirement)\nSample Data Source: Federal Reserve Flow of Funds, Survey of Consumer Finances",

Indeed seasonally adjusts each series based on historical patterns in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Each series, including the national trend, occupational sectors, and sub-national geographies, is seasonally adjusted separately. Indeed switched to this new methodology in January 2021 and now reports all historical data using this new methodology. Historical numbers have been revised and may differ significantly from originally reported values. The new methodology applies a detrended seasonal adjustment factor to the percentage change in job postings.

The source provides this data at https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/.\n\nTax-adjusted income is the sum of Net Interest Income (call item RIAD4074) and annualized Income/Loss before Income Taxes and Extraordinary Items and Other Adjustments (call item RIAD4301), which is multiplied by the corresponding tax rate based on the annual income level. Currently, Average Earning Assets is computed as the sum of Interest-Bearing Balances (call item RCFD0071); Total Loans and Leases, Net of Unearned Income (call item RCFD2122); Total Trading Assets (call item RCFD3545); Total Held-to-Maturity Securities (call item RCFD1754); Total Amortized Cost of Available-For-Sale Securities (call item RCFD1772); Federal Funds Sold (call item RCONB987); Securities Purchased Under Agreement to Resell (call item RCFDB989).\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis includes the sum of Federal Funds Sold (call item RCONB987) and Securities Purchased Under Agreement to Resell (call item RCFDB989) in lieu of call item RCFD1350 (Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell in Domestic Offices of the Bank and of Its Edge and Agreement Subsidiaries, and in International Banking Facilities(IBFs)) beginning in the first quarter of 2002.\n\nBefore 1993 the Average Earning Assets was the sum of Interest-Bearing Balances (call item RCFD0071); Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell in Domestic Offices of the Bank and of Its Edge and Agreement Subsidiaries, and in International Banking Facilities(IBFs) (call item RCFD1350); Total Investment Securities at Book Value (call item RCFD0390); Total Loans and Leases, Net of Unearned Income (call item RCFD2122); Total Assets Held in Trading Accounts (call item RCFD2146).\n\nGeographic location is determined by Abbreviated State Name, 'IL' (call item RSSD9200), the two character state abbreviation for Illinois.\n\nUsers are advised to use the Federal Reserve Board of Governors' data dictionary (https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/mdrm/data-dictionary) to retrieve detailed information for specific call items.",
