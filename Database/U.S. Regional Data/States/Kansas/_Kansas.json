The bureau's main objective with this program is to provide estimates of income and poverty for the administration of federal programs and the allocation of federal funds to local jurisdictions. In addition to these federal programs, state and local programs use the income and poverty estimates for distributing funds and managing programs.\n\nTax exemptions are one of the data sources used in producing SAIPE program estimates. This series represents the number of exemptions on IRS returns identified as child exemptions (including children at or away from home).\n\nSee more details about SAIPE Model Input Data (https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/saipe/model-tables.html).",

    "notes": "Indeed calculates the percentage change in seasonally-adjusted job postings since February 1, 2020, using a 7-day trailing average. February 1, 2020, is the pre-pandemic baseline. Indeed seasonally adjusts each series based on historical patterns in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Each series, including the national trend, occupational sectors, and sub-national geographies, is seasonally adjusted separately. Indeed switched to this new methodology in January 2021 and now reports all historical data using this new methodology. Historical numbers have been revised and may differ significantly from originally reported values. The new methodology applies a detrended seasonal adjustment factor to the percentage change in job postings.
