  "notes": "This series represents the contributions of Wisconsin's services sector to the Relative Midwest Economy Index (RMEI). This series is the weighted average of state variables measuring the growth in nonfarm business activity based on services sector indicators for the Wisconsin.\n\nA zero value represents an average contribution to RMEI by the state of Wisconsin services sector, a rate historically consistent with the growth of the national economy, whereas positive values indicate above-average relative contribution; and negative values indicate below average relative contribution.\n\nFor further information about the Relative Midwest Economy Index, go to http://midwest.chicagofedblogs.org/archives/2011/03/mei_by_scott_br.html and http://chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/chicago_fed_letter/2010/cflnovember2010_280.pdf."
