  "notes": "The crude death rate is the number of deaths reported each calendar year divided by the population, multiplied by 100,000. Premature death rate includes all deaths where the deceased is younger than 75 years of age. 75 years of age is the standard consideration of a premature death according to the CDC's definition of Years of Potential Life Loss.\n\nStarting with the 2019 vintage, the CDC no longer calculates rates for a county when the death count is less than 20, marking them as \"unreliable.\" FRED records these instances as missing observations in the series.\n\nFor more information see the Frequently Asked Questions about Death Rates (https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Frequently%20Asked%20Questions%20about%20Death%20Rates)."
