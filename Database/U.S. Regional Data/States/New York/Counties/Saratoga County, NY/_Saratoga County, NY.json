    "notes": "This data represents the ratio of the mean income for the highest quintile (top 20 percent) of earners divided by the mean income of the lowest quintile (bottom 20 percent) of earners in a particular county. Multiyear estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) are \"period\" estimates derived from a data sample collected over a period of time, as opposed to \"point-in-time\" estimates such as those from past decennial censuses. ACS 5-year estimate includes data collected over a 60-month period. The date of the data is the end of the 5-year period. For example, a value dated 2014 represents data from 2010 to 2014. However, they  do  not  describe  any  specific day, month, or year within that time period.\n\nMultiyear  estimates  require  some  considerations  that  single-year  estimates  do  not.  For  example,  multiyear  estimates released in consecutive years consist mostly of overlapping years and shared data. The 2010\u20132014 ACS 5-year estimates share sample data from 2011 through 2014 with the 2011\u20132015 ACS 5-year estimates. Because of this overlap, users should use extreme caution in making comparisons with consecutive years of multiyear estimates.\n\nPlease see \"Section 3: Understanding and Using ACS Single-Year and Multiyear Estimates\" on publication page 13 (file page 19) of the 2018 ACS General Handbook for a more thorough clarification. https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/acs_general_handbook_2018.pdf"

As with the standard FHFA HPIs, revisions to these indexes may reflect the impact of new data or technical adjustments. Indexes are calibrated using appraisal values and sales prices for mortgages bought or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As discussed in the Working Paper 16-01, in cases where sample sizes are small for the county area, an index is either not reported if recording has not started or a missing value is reported with a period (.). Index values always reflect the native county index, i.e. they are not made with data from another area or year.\n\n For tracking and feedback purposes, please cite Working Paper 16-01 when using these data. A suggested form is: Bogin, A., Doerner, W. and Larson, W. (2016). Local House Price Dynamics: New Indices and Stylized Facts. Federal Housing Finance Agency, Working Paper 16-01.

The new methodology uses the latest and most accurate data mapping of listing statuses to yield a cleaner and more consistent measurement of active listings at both the national and local level. The methodology has also been adjusted to better account for missing data in some fields including square footage. Most areas across the country will see minor changes with a smaller handful of areas seeing larger updates. As a result of these changes, the data released since December 2021 will not be directly comparable with previous data releases (files downloaded before December 2021) and Realtor.com\u00ae economics blog posts. However, future data releases, including historical data, will consistently apply the new methodology.

    "notes": "Burdened households are those households who pay 30 percent or more of their household income on housing (such as rent or mortgage expenses).\n\nThis is calculated as the sum of households with a mortgage spending 30.0-34.9% of their income on selected monthly owner costs, households with a mortgage spending 35.0% or more of their income on selected monthly owner costs, households without a mortgage spending 30.0-34.9% of their income on selected monthly owner costs, households without a mortgage spending 35.0% or more of their income on selected monthly owner costs, households that rent spending 30.0-34.9% of their income on gross rent, and households that rent spending 35.0% or more of their income on gross rent (ACS 5-year variables DP04_0114E, DP04_0115E, DP04_0123E, DP04_0124E, DP04_0141E, and DP04_0142E respectively from table DP04) divided by the sum of the total number of households with a mortgage, the total number of households without a mortgage, and the total number of households that rent (ACS 5-year variables DP04_0110E, DP04_0117E, and DP04_0136E respectively from table DP04). Note that the calculation excludes households where selected monthly owner costs or gross rent cannot be calculated.\n\nSelected monthly owner costs are the sum of payments for mortgages, deeds of trust, contracts to purchase, or similar debts on the property (including payments for the first mortgage, second mortgages, home equity loans, and other junior mortgages); real estate taxes; fire, hazard, and flood insurance on the property; utilities (electricity, gas, and water and sewer); and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.). It also includes, where appropriate, the monthly condominium fee for condominiums and mobile home costs (installment loan payments, personal property taxes, site rent, registration fees, and license fees).\n\nGross rent provides information on the monthly housing cost expenses for renters. Gross rent is the contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities (electricity, gas, and water and sewer) and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.) if these are paid by the renter (or paid for the renter by someone else). Gross rent is intended to eliminate differentials that result from varying practices with respect to the inclusion of utilities and fuels as part of the rental payment. The estimated costs of water and sewer, and fuels are reported on a 12-month basis but are converted to monthly figures for the tabulations.\n\nMultiyear estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) are \"period\" estimates derived from a data sample collected over a period of time, as opposed to \"point-in-time\" estimates such as those from past decennial censuses. ACS 5-year estimate includes data collected over a 60-month period. The date of the data is the end of the 5-year period. For example, a value dated 2014 represents data from 2010 to 2014. However, they do not describe any specific day, month, or year within that time period.\n\nMultiyear estimates require some considerations that single-year estimates do not. For example, multiyear estimates released in consecutive years consist mostly of overlapping years and shared data. The 2010-2014 ACS 5-year estimates share sample data from 2011 through 2014 with the 2011-2015 ACS 5-year estimates. Because of this overlap, users should use extreme caution in making comparisons with consecutive years of multiyear estimates.\n\nPlease see \"Section 3: Understanding and Using ACS Single-Year and Multiyear Estimates\" on publication page 13 (file page 19) of the 2018 ACS General Handbook (https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/acs_general_handbook_2018.pdf) for a more thorough clarification."

Note that these data do not represent county totals as they exclude crime counts for city agencies and other types of agencies that have jurisdiction within each county.\n\nThe FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program collects the number of offenses that come to the attention of law enforcement for violent crime and property crime, as well as data regarding clearances of these offenses. In addition, the FBI collects auxiliary information about these offenses (e.g., time of day of burglaries).\n\nViolent crime is composed of four offenses: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes are defined in the UCR Program as those offenses that involve force or threat of force.\n\nProperty crime includes the offenses of burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson. The object of the theft-type offenses is the taking of money or property, but there is no force or threat of force against the victims.\n\nSee Table 10 Data Declaration (https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-10/table-10-data-declaration) for more information."

    "notes": "The homeownership rate is computed by dividing the estimated total population in owner-occupied units by the estimated total population (ACS 5-year variables B25008_002E and B25008_001E from table B25008, respectively).\n\nA housing unit is owner-occupied if the owner or co-owner lives in the unit, even if it is mortgaged or not fully paid for. A housing unit is classified as occupied if it is the current place of residence of the person or group of people living in it at the time of interview, or if the occupants are only temporarily absent from the residence for two months or less (e.g., on vacation or a business trip). If all the people staying in the unit at the time of the interview are staying there for two months or less, the unit is considered to be temporarily occupied and classified as \"vacant.\"\n\nMultiyear estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) are \"period\" estimates derived from a data sample collected over a period of time, as opposed to \"point-in-time\" estimates such as those from past decennial censuses. ACS 5-year estimate includes data collected over a 60-month period. The date of the data is the end of the 5-year period. For example, a value dated 2014 represents data from 2010 to 2014. However, they do not describe any specific day, month, or year within that time period.\n\nMultiyear estimates require some considerations that single-year estimates do not. For example, multiyear estimates released in consecutive years consist mostly of overlapping years and shared data. The 2010-2014 ACS 5-year estimates share sample data from 2011 through 2014 with the 2011-2015 ACS 5-year estimates. Because of this overlap, users should use extreme caution in making comparisons with consecutive years of multiyear estimates.\n\nPlease see \"Section 3: Understanding and Using ACS Single-Year and Multiyear Estimates\" on publication page 13 (file page 19) of the 2018 ACS General Handbook (https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/acs_general_handbook_2018.pdf) for a more thorough clarification."

Then the series is adjusted for cost of living using regional price parities (RPP) from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis' Real Personal Income for States and Metropolitan Areas (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release?rid=403&soid=18). Finally to approximate the wage, the series is divided by (52 * 40), which assumes there are 52 weeks in a year and 40 work hours in a week. Note that household income can include additional sources of income beyond wages. See page 83 in the ACS's Subject Definitions (https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/subject_definitions/2019_ACSSubjectDefinitions.pdf) for more information.\n\nACS 1-year estimates are not available for all geographic areas. If a county is not included in the 1-year estimates for a given year, the series will not revise or there will be a missing observation. See the Areas Published (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/geography-acs/areas-published.html) for more details about the geographies included in the ACS 1-year estimates.\n\nThe RPP used to calculate this series is NYNMPRPPALL (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NYNMPRPPALL). If the RPP for the region is zero or missing for a given year, the series will not revise or there will be a missing observation."

    "notes": "The American Community Survey (ACS) and the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS) ask respondents age 1 year and over whether they lived in the same residence 1 year ago. For people who lived in a different residence, the location of their previous residence is collected.\n\nACS uses a series of monthly samples to produce estimates. The 5-year dataset is used for the county-to-county migration flows since many counties have a population less than 20,000. Multiyear estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) are \"period\" estimates derived from a data sample collected over a period of time, as opposed to \"point-in-time\" estimates such as those from past decennial censuses. ACS 5-year estimate includes data collected over a 60-month period. The date of the data is the end of the 5-year period. For example, a value dated 2014 represents data from 2010 to 2014. However, they do not describe any specific day, month, or year within that time period.\n\nMultiyear estimates require some considerations that single-year estimates do not. For example, multiyear estimates released in consecutive years consist mostly of overlapping years and shared data. The 2010-2014 ACS 5-year estimates share sample data from 2011 through 2014 with the 2011-2015 ACS 5-year estimates. Because of this overlap, users should use extreme caution in making comparisons with consecutive years of multiyear estimates.\n\nPlease see \"Section 3: Understanding and Using ACS Single-Year and Multiyear Estimates\" on publication page 13 (file page 19) of the 2018 ACS General Handbook (https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/acs_general_handbook_2018.pdf) for a more thorough clarification."

Each employed person is counted only once, even if he or she holds more than one job.\n\nUnemployed persons are all persons who had no employment during the reference week, were available for work, except for temporary illness, and had made specific efforts to find employment some time during the 4 week-period ending with the reference week. Persons who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been laid off need not have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed.\n\nThe unemployment rate is the unemployed percent of the civilian labor force [100 times (unemployed/civilian labor force)].\n\nFor more details, see the release's <a href=https://www.bls.gov/lau/laufaq.htm>frequently asked questions</a>."

    "notes": "Personal Income is the income that is received by all persons from all sources. It is calculated as the sum of wages and salaries, supplements to wages and salaries, proprietors' income with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment, personal dividend income, personal interest income, and personal current transfer receipts, less contributions for government social insurance. The personal income of an area is the income that is received by, or on behalf of, all the individuals who live in the area; therefore, the estimates of personal income are presented by the place of residence of the income recipients."

The poverty universe does not include children under the age of 15 who are not related to a reference person within the household by way of birth, marriage or adoption (for example, foster children). The reason is that Census Bureau surveys typically ask income questions only of persons age 15 or older and those under 15 related to a reference person within the household.\n 2.

Zero values represent counties where the proportions of non-white population and non-hispanic white population are the same. Multiyear estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) are \"period\" estimates derived from a data sample collected over a period of time, as opposed to \"point-in-time\" estimates such as those from past decennial censuses. ACS 5-year estimate includes data collected over a 60-month period. The date of the data is the end of the 5-year period. For example, a value dated 2014 represents data from 2010 to 2014. However, they do not describe any specific day, month, or year within that time period.\n\nMultiyear estimates require some considerations that single-year estimates do not. For example, multiyear estimates released in consecutive years consist mostly of overlapping years and shared data. The 2010\u20132014 ACS 5-year estimates share sample data from 2011 through 2014 with the 2011\u20132015 ACS 5-year estimates. Because of this overlap, users should use extreme caution in making comparisons with consecutive years of multiyear estimates.\n\nPlease see \"Section 3: Understanding and Using ACS Single-Year and Multiyear Estimates\" on publication page 13 (file page 19) of the 2018 ACS General Handbook (https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/acs_general_handbook_2018.pdf) for a more thorough clarification."

    "notes": "The supply score is an index representing a zip code, county or metro's median days on market ranking compared to other zip codes, counties or metros.\n\nWith the release of its November 2021 housing trends report, Realtor.com\u00ae incorporated a new and improved methodology for capturing and reporting housing inventory trends and metrics. The new methodology uses the latest and most accurate data mapping of listing statuses to yield a cleaner and more consistent measurement of active listings at both the national and local level. The methodology has also been adjusted to better account for missing data in some fields including square footage. Most areas across the country will see minor changes with a smaller handful of areas seeing larger updates. As a result of these changes, the data released since December 2021 will not be directly comparable with previous data releases (files downloaded before December 2021) and Realtor.com\u00ae economics blog posts. However, future data releases, including historical data, will consistently apply the new methodology.

    "notes": "The number of patent assignments for a county is based upon the cumulative assignees in a county for the designated time-period, i.e. the total number of patents transferred to assignees based in the county represented over the course of the particular month.\n\nAssignment, in patent and trademark terms, is the act of transferring to another the ownership of one's property; meaning the interest and rights to a patent as defined by the <a href='https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/index.html'>Manual of Patent Examining Procedure</a> (MPEP). In order for an assignment to take place, the transfer to another must include the entirety of the 'bundle of rights' associated with the ownership interest, meaning all of the rights that are inherent in the right, title, and interest in the patent or patent application.\n\nThe assignee is the person, group of persons, or organization that receives ownership rights of the patent application or patent from the assignor.\n\nPlease visit the <a href='https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/transferring-ownership-assignments-faqs'>Transferring Ownership/Assignments FAQs</a> to query it for more information about assignments in general."
