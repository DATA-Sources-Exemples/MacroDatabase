  "notes": "The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis seasonally adjusts this series by using the 'statsmodel' library from Python with default parameter settings. The package uses the U.S. Bureau of the Census X-13ARIMA-SEATS Seasonal Adjustment Program. More information on the 'statsmodel' X-13ARIMA-SEATS package can be found here (https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.x13.x13_arima_analysis.html). More information on X-13ARIMA-SEATS can be found here (https://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/).\n\nNew York City, NY constitutes a significant percentage of the state's total statewide employment. This series is calculated in addition to the New York-Wayne-White Plains, NY-NJ (MD)'s statistics because of it's importance to the state. For more details on non-standard area definitions, visit the additional resources (https://www.bls.gov/sae/additional-resources/non-standard-ces-areas.htm) of the Current Employment Statistics."
