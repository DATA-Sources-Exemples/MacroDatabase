Each employed person is counted only once, even if he or she holds more than one job.\n\nUnemployed persons are all persons who had no employment during the reference week, were available for work, except for temporary illness, and had made specific efforts to find employment some time during the 4 week-period ending with the reference week. Persons who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been laid off need not have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed.\n\nFor more details, see the release's <a href=https://www.bls.gov/lau/laufaq.htm>frequently asked questions</a>."

Each employed person is counted only once, even if he or she holds more than one job.\n\nUnemployed persons are all persons who had no employment during the reference week, were available for work, except for temporary illness, and had made specific efforts to find employment some time during the 4 week-period ending with the reference week. Persons who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been laid off need not have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed.\n\nThe unemployment rate is the unemployed percent of the civilian labor force [100 times (unemployed/civilian labor force)].\n\nFor more details, see the release's <a href=https://www.bls.gov/lau/laufaq.htm>frequently asked questions</a>."
