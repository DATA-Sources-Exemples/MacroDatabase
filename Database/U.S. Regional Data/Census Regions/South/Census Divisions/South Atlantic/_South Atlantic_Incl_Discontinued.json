Total loans equals Total Loans and Leases, Net of Unearned Income call item RCFD2122.\nThe asset classes are determined by using Average Total Assets call item RCFD2170 less than $300M.\nGeographic location for South Atlantic Census Division is determined by the Physical State Code call item RSSD9210 IN (10,11,12,13,24,37,45,51,54), where the number codes represent Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia respectively.\n\nUsers are advised to use the Federal Reserve Board of Governors' data dictionary (https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/mdrm/data-dictionary) to retrieve detailed information for specific call items.\n\nThis series is calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis using raw data that are collected by the FFIEC.
