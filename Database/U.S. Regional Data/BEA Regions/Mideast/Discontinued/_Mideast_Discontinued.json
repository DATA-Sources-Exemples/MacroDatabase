More information on this program can be found at https://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/.\nThe seasonal moving average function used is that of the Census Bureau's X-11-ARIMA program. This includes a 3x3 moving average for the initial seasonal factors and a 3x5 moving average to calculate the final seasonal factors. The D11 function is also used to output the entire seasonally adjusted series that is displayed.
