  "notes": "A seasonal factor measures the percentage amount that on average, monthly production is above or below normal. A seasonal factor of 120 states that the month in question will usually be 20% above an average month's production level. Similarly, a seasonal factor of 100 implies an average month, while a factor of 80 implies a month that is typically 20% below average.\n\nThe not seasonally adjusted (NSA) data for light truck assemblies (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MVALTTRCKN) are obtained from Ward's Communications, and the seasonal factors (SF), which contain adjustments for holiday and length-of-month effects as well as normal seasonal variation, are applied to MVALTTRCKN (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MVALTTRCKN) using the formula found here (https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/mvsf.htm)."
