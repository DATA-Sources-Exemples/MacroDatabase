    "notes": "Patent origin is determined by the residence of the first-named inventor.\n\nA design consists of the visual ornamental characteristics embodied in, or applied to, an article of manufacture. Since a design is manifested in appearance, the subject matter of a design patent application may relate to the configuration or shape of an article, to the surface ornamentation applied to an article, or to the combination of configuration and surface ornamentation. A design for surface ornamentation is inseparable from the article to which it is applied and cannot exist alone. It must be a definite pattern of surface ornamentation, applied to an article of manufacture.\n\nSee PTMT Products and Services Brochure (https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/brochure.htm) and Types of patent applications and proceedings (https://www.uspto.gov/patents/basics/types-patent-applications) for more information."
