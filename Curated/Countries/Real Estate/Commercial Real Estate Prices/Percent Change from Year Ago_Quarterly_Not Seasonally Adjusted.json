Currently, there is limited international experience in constructing representative real estate price indices as real estate markets are heterogeneous, both within and across countries, and illiquid. A rapid increase in real estate prices, followed by a sharp economic downturn, can have a detrimental effect on financial sector soundness by affecting credit quality and the value of collateral.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016, International Monetary Fund.
