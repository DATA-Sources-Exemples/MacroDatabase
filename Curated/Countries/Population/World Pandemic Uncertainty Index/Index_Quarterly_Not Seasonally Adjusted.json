    "notes": "The World Pandemic Uncertainty Index is constructed by counting the number of times uncertainty is mentioned within a proximity to a word related to pandemics in the Economist Intelligence Unit country reports. Specifically, the index is the percent of the word \"uncertain\", and its variants, that appear near the pandemic terms in EIU country reports, multiplied by 1,000. A higher number means higher uncertainty related to pandemics and vice versa.\n\nPlease see Hites Ahir, Nicholas Bloom and Davide Furceri (2018), 'The World Uncertainty Index' (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3275033) for additional explanation.",
