The break-adjusted series are the result of the BIS's own calculations, and were obtained by adjusting levels through standard statistical techniques described in the special feature on the long credit series of the March 2013 issue of the BIS Quarterly Review at https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1303h.htm.
